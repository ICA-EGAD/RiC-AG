What is this part about?
------------------------

In this part of the Application Guidelines, we will focus upon the Sámi, an indigenous people, and how Records in Contexts might be of use to them. At the [end](#other-minority-groups), we will suggest that the fundamentals of the discussion may generalise to other minority groups.

A difficult matter
-----------------

The challenges facing the Sámi people are numerous, deep, and difficult. Epistemological assumptions implicit in any Western — for want of a better term — endeavour such as RiC are challenged by indigenous conceptions of a Record, and only a semantics immersed in Sámi culture could hope to truly do justice to Sámi records. Nevertheless, interactions between the Sámi people and Western institutions, largely upon the premises of the latter, are as significant for the Sámi people today as ever, and have frequent recourse to archival materials. It is here that RiC, alongside parallel initiatives, may have something to offer.

That traditional archive practices are problematic when it comes to indigenous peoples is well-established. For well over a century, records have primarily been organized within hierarchies, usually with public institutions at their top. The relationship between the Sámi and these institutions is a complex, interwoven one that has evolved over a long period of time — interactions sometimes being Sámi-initiated for Sámi purposes, not only the other way around — but also a hegemonic one; the Sámi are almost invisible in such hierarchies. In addition, the lack of sensitivity to indigenous perspectives, both within the archival and records management domain and in society generally, has led to the omission or obscuration of indigenous peoples both in records themselves and in description of them.

RiC breaks down some of these barriers from a theoretical perspective. It is fundamentally de-centralized rather than hierarchical, and also is intensional rather than extensional: in RiC a Record is not pre-conceived, with fields to be filled in to describe it, rather it is defined by its relation to other entities, i.e. in a context which is dynamic and allows for nuance and different perspectives — relations can always be added, elaborated upon, or qualified. We shall now discuss a few concrete examples of this; we hope that the discussion will inspire more!


Challenging over-reliance on sources
------------------------------------

In legal cases pertaining to indigenous rights, references to the Sámi in archival material are important. One source of these are censuses of the population of Norway: the designations _lapp_ or _finn_ (with spelling variants) indicated that a person was a Sámi. But this has been turned upon its head: if few or no such appellations are to be found in a census for a given area, it has frequently been concluded, both in legal matters and by historians, that there is little or no evidence of Sámi having been historically present in the area.

However, focusing upon the census of 1801 in Norway and upon the South Sámi, an [article](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-05029-0_4) argues on several grounds that this kind of volte-face is not justifiable. There are contradictions between the census and parish registers, methodological issues, and implausible dates. as the article draws attention to, this is despite the National Archives of Norway giving the following [guidance](https://www.arkivverket.no/en/find-your-ancestors/public-censuses#!%23block-body-2) at the time of writing:

> The 1801 census has rightfully gained its reputation as solid and reliable. It was carried out on Sunday, February 1, 1801, and is based on complete lists of individuals.

The modelling below suggests one way that the objections of the article might be brought into a description of the 1801 census, providing context. Archival processes — whether facilitated by software or manual — built upon RiC would allow the Rule in the model to be discovered upon consideration of the 1801 census, or of any of the other entities present. For the sake of the modelling, we make an assumption that it is reasonable to formulate the entities in the diagram for the Sámi people as a whole, though Hermanstrand's article focuses specifically upon the South Sámi.

[![Tackling over-reliance on sources](../diagrams/tackling_over-reliance_on_sources.svg)](../diagrams/tackling_over-reliance_on_sources.svg)

Points of note include:


1. The use of Activity and Rule to refer to archival activities in the way we do in the model is a principal theme in these guidelines. See [int-ref](int-ref:faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions:are-activity-and-event-central-entities-in-ric-how-about-rule-and-place).
2. The decentralized nature of RiC is such that the entity for the Sámi people, modelled as a Group is as valid a point of entrance into this description — all arrows in RiC have an inverse which goes in the reverse direction! — as any other in the diagram. In archival standards prior to RiC, such an entity would almost certainly not exist: the Sámi people as a whole are almost certainly not e.g. the creator of any fonds.
3. We make use of the fact that in RiC a Record Set need not have an Instantiation, so that we are free to form intellectual aggregations for the convenience of a description. Indeed, the 1801 census of Norway does not exist in any physical form, being comprized of one volume per parish, these being held by different regional archives in Norway. Nor does the aggregation defined by 'parish registers around 1801': even if held at the same location, these belong to different series, and sometimes different fonds, in today's hierarchies. We shall return to this in greater depth [below](#weaving-together-fragments).
4. Though we have modelled Hermanstrand's journal article only as a Thing, it would be very possible to use a bibliographic standard to give more details. See [int-ref](int-ref:extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote:beyond-the-traditional-archival-context) for an example of this.
5. As in [int-ref](int-ref:faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions:is-describing-the-content-of-a-record-within-rics-domain) and in general with meta-metadata (see [int-ref](int-ref:faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions:do-you-have-examples-illustrating-chapter-6-of-ric-cm)), it would be possible to replace the use of the Scope and content attribute with free-text content in the model with a Record and an Event.

In RiC, aspects of the analysis of the article might also be modelled, to quite a degree of granularity. See the following diagram for an example.

[![Details over-reliance on sources](../diagrams/details_over-reliance_on_sources.svg)](../diagrams/details_over-reliance_on_sources.svg)

The entry for Magnild Andersdatter in the Alstahaug parish register modelled here is the first in the fifth row from the top on right-hand side of page 4 of [this digitisation](https://media.digitalarkivet.no/view/2577/7) of it. The more structured form of parish register discussed in [int-ref](int-ref:faq--record_or_record_set:parish-registers) had not yet arrived — it did so about ten years later.

As always, still further details could be added to enrich the modelling. For instance, a [search](https://www.digitalarkivet.no/en/census/search/1801?fornavn=Magnild&etternavn=Andersdatter&familiestilling=&sivilstand=&yrke=&fodselsaar=&alder=&ny_husholdning=&merknader=&bosted=&bydel=&gaardsnummer=) for the name Magnild Andersdatter amongst transcriptions of the 1801 census does point to a woman of the same marital status and occupation registered in the census volume for Vefsn, near the bottom of the left-hand side of page 70b-71a of [this digitisation](https://media.digitalarkivet.no/view/58469/8) of it. But even if this were to be the same person, it would only strengthen the arguments in the article as a whole, no indication being given that the woman in Vefsn is a Sámi, by contrast with the grouping of designated Sámi at the end of the census for this parish.


Incorporating map data into a Sámi context
------------------------------------------

The Sámi people are and were diverse in their ways of life — [below](#weaving-together-fragments) we shall focus upon traces of Sámi communities near the coast much further south in Norway than exist today. But reindeer herding is an important part of the Sámi identity, and a typical ingredient in high-profile conflicts.

There exist comprehensive scientific resources documenting the immense impact of industry, transport infrastructure, and other kinds of activity upon reindeer, for example the [maps](https://reindeermaps.nina.no/) of the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA). The research data underlying these maps fits into records management/archival orthodoxy, and it is more or less certain that somebody exploring NINA's work on reindeer will find the data. Much less obvious is that the data will be discovered by someone whose point of departure is Sámi rights; they would first have to realise that NINA might be a place to look.

Stepping outside of a hierarchy with NINA at the top, and outside the domain of statistics/research, as RiC can, would help. How this might look is suggested in the following model. As in the previous section, a key aspect of the following is the way in which a thread is formally sewn between the Record Set and the Sámi people.

[![Reindeer populations](../diagrams/reindeer_populations.svg)](../diagrams/reindeer_populations.svg)

A couple of technical notes:

1. This example may be a good one to reflect upon with regard to the distinction between Activity and Event, touched upon in [int-ref](int-ref:faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions:can-you-elaborate-upon-the-difference-between-activity-and-event). In particular, following the criteria there, 'Impact of human activities upon reindeer populations' is judged an Event rather than an Activity because it lacks the 'agent-designed and performed' and 'intended purpose' aspects of an Activity.
2. We have deliberately not made use of the relation _has or had derived instantiation_ between the 'Data files on reindeer populations' Instantiation and the Thing representing the website of reindeer maps. Indeed, such a relation would likely be judged to imply — even if this is not quite explicitly stated in RiC-CM or enforced in RiC-O at the present time — that the website is also an Instantiation of the Record Set in the model. This does not seem quite correct: the website is more of a tool to visualise some of the data in that Record Set, which we may contrast with the digital photo album example given in [int-ref](int-ref:faq--the_instantiation_entity:instantiations-of-record-sets) — there the essential aspects of the original photo collection seem likely to have been preserved.

    Instead, as we also do in [int-ref](int-ref:faq--record_or_record_set:record-part), [int-ref](int-ref:extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote:broader-cultural-heritage-aspects), and [int-ref](int-ref:extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote:beyond-the-traditional-archival-context), we have stepped outside of RiC and made use of a couple of properties from another standard, the Dublin Core vocabulary in this case.

Whilst it is possible to drill down, the data on reindeer in the above models is first and foremost at a macro-level. An [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214790X22000090) on the impact of mines in Sweden in 2022 provides more localized insights.

As another [article](ODBlZWUzN2Q2NTQwNWNk) from 2018 conveys well, the Sámi conception of a route across land is fundamentally different from the Western one. Data like that gathered for the 2022 article is invaluable in lieu of a direct way, in a Western setting, for the Sámi to point to a record of their use of the land.

Indeed, though it is only implicit in the study, in RiC we may deem this data to _actually_ be a Record of a traditional reindeer herding route. We suggest a model below.

[![Documenting reindeer routes](../diagrams/documenting_reindeer_routes.svg)](../diagrams/documenting_reindeer_routes.svg)

Some notes on this model:

1. Being freed from a necessity to classify records into where they fit into a hierarchical scheme of things, we [again](#challenging-over-reliance-on-sources) need not, at this point in time, make any judgement as to what Record Sets the Record might belong to.
2. It is not asserted in the model that the research article itself is a Record. Indeed, on the one hand we regard the writing of this article as part of the provenance of the Record, as expressed in the modelling. On the other we regard the article as having the same relationship to the Record in the model as the reindeer maps website has to the underlying data it visualises.
3. There is ontological force in an archivist or records manager making the judgement that the Record in the model documents a traditional reindeer herding route. It has archival implications: necessitating that preservation and availability of this Record take into account its aspect of documenting the traditional reindeer route, for instance, and facilitating inter-operability — allowing records on traditional routes spanning different holders of material to be joined into a stronger whole. It alsohas legal and political implications: it provides a concrete, institutionalized 'hook' for matters involving traditional reindeer routes: funding applications, court cases, and so on.


Weaving together fragments
--------------------------

There is evidence that Sámi lived in the coastal region of Norway known as Nordmøre in the 1700s and 1800s. References in archival material, though, are fragmentary. Because of this, the position has sometimes been taken that it is impossible to include the Sámi within a narrative of the area's history: see for instance the controversy referred to in [this 2017 article](https://www.scup.com/doi/full/10.18261/issn.1894-3195-2017-02-03), in Norwegian, but with an English abstract.

In RiC, as we noted [above](#challenging-over-reliance-on-sources), one is free to form purely intellectual aggregations (a Record Set). These have equal weight to traditional types of archival aggregations (series, etc) which reflect physical collections of material. We might take this approach with the Nordmøre references to Sámi.

We now list some of these references. More can be found [here](https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/Samisk_historie_p%C3%A5_Nordm%C3%B8re_og_i_S%C3%B8r-Fosen). This webpage is outside the archival domain at the time of writing, but the Record Set we shall suggest below could be formed is a way in which the data underlying the webpage could be brought within into the archival sphere.

1. Certain place names, such as [Finnvika](https://www.norgeskart.no/#!?project=norgeskart&layers=1001&zoom=14&lat=7016041.28&lon=148469.91&sok=finnvika&markerLat=7016069.047372117&markerLon=148944.6058513549&p=searchOptionsPanel&showSelection=false), near Langøya, a little to the east of Kristiansund, point to the possible presence of a Sámi community at one time.
2. There are several mentions of Sámi people in parish registers and court records pertaining to Nordmøre or nearby in the 1700s. For example (all links only in Norwegian):
    1. A [court case](https://media.digitalarkivet.no/view/16118/10) concerning an event in Tingvoll in 1732, summarized [here](https://gaavnoes.no/2016/04/en-same-avslorer-et-tyveri-i-tingvoll-i-1732/).
    2. The [imprisoning](https://www.digitalarkivet.no/view/84/pc00000000305794) in Trondheim of a Sámi woman from Smøla, discussed [here](https://blogg.forskning.no/i-grenseland-sorsamisk-i-midt-norge/sorsamer-lofoten-og-kysten/1220455).
    3. The death of a 28 year old Sámi [in Aure](https://media.digitalarkivet.no/view/16108/79) on the 3rd of February 1786, and of a 57 year old "foreign Sámi" [in Aure](https://media.digitalarkivet.no/view/16108/122) on the 31st of May 1791. In both cases the designation "finn" (in its Danish-Norwegian form "find") is used, which was more typical for Sámi living near the coast.
3. A [Sámi purse](https://digitaltmuseum.no/0211814602979/samer-pa-nordmore-en-gang-mer-vanlig-enn-vi-har-trodd) was found in the area. Although this is the domain of museums, RiC can link to it, as we shall illustrate below.
4. An [archaelogical find](https://www.kulturminnesok.no/kart/?q=&am-county=&lokenk=location&am-lok=&am-lokdating=&am-lokconservation=&am-enk=&am-enkdating=&am-enkconservation=&bm-county=&cp=1&bounds=63.314371632023125,8.37156057357788,63.31274542149193,8.373706340789795&zoom=18&id=a548577e-54ab-11eb-818d-005056bf3d73) exists at Grisvågøya, thought to be a Sámi place of sacrifice.
5. There are [references](https://digitaltmuseum.no/0211814602979/samer-pa-nordmore-en-gang-mer-vanlig-enn-vi-har-trodd) to Sámi people in folk material. In a tale with its origins near Hov church in Sunndalsøra, a Sámi dispatches a problematic human-like troll (jutul) to the interior of a nearby mountain, with the instruction that it  must remain there until not a hair was left upon a calf-skin, the troll being permitted to pluck one hair of it each Christmas Eve.

    There are influential currents in modern archival theory — diplomatics, as it known, for instance — which dismiss this kind of material. for its not lending itself to a scientific analysis of provenance. RiC, though, allows for all kind of archival contexts, leaving what to bring in to the judgement and preference of its users.

The model below gathers together these references. In this way, their aggregation becomes formalized and, if carried out by an authoritative body, institutionalized. This may enable the material to stand stronger, for the same kind of reasons as we suggested in the final paragraph of the [previous section](#incorporating-map-data-into-a-sámi-context).

[![Weaving fragments](../diagrams/weaving_fragments.svg)](../diagrams/weaving_fragments.svg)

A few notes on the modelling:

1. In practice, meta-metadata would likely be included in the modelling: who discovered a particular reference, when it was discovered, and so on. See [int-ref](int-ref:faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions:do-you-have-examples-illustrating-chapter-6-of-ric-cm) for more on how this could be done.
2. [CIDOC CRM](https://cidoc-crm.org/) and other cultural heritage standards can take over where RiC stops to enrich the description of the two Thing entities in the model. See [int-ref](int-ref:extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote:beyond-the-traditional-archival-context) for an example of this.
3. In [int-ref](int-ref:faq--record_or_record_set:parish-registers), we discussed in detail that a parish register can be viewed as a Record or Record Set depending upon the context. Above we have modelled each of the two parish registers as a Record Set, since we primarily view them as aggregations: apart from the fact that they have records of Sámi people, what they aggregate is irrelevant for us in the context of the model.

One might take this example much further, incorporating transnational aspects for instance, these being particularly relevant for the Sámi. The microhistorical analysis carried out in the article [Between Sundsvall and Smøla](https://www.scup.com/doi/10.18261/heimen.61.3.4) (only available in Norwegian) by Hermanstrand and Solsten is very much in this vein.

Other minority groups
---------------------

The issues of material being fragmented and/or underground, and quite possibly turned on its head where it _is_ to be found, are common to many minority groups, whether defined by ethnicity, race, sexuality, religion, or anything else. Techniques which RiC paves the way for, such as those touched on above, may be helpful in circumventing those practices which are a primary cause of, and reinforce, these issues — arising ultimately from mismatches of power, but typically exercised unconsciously by archivists and records managers going about their daily work.
