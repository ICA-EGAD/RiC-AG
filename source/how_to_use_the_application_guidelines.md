----------

The site can be browsed linearly using the arrows and links in the headers and footers of its pages, or readers may wish to hop in and out of parts of sections of interest. The vertical arrows after section headers will take you to the top of the page. Diagrams will expand when clicked upon.

Themes
------

The various [parts](table_of_contents.html) of these Application Guidelines fall into two broad categories. Firstly, those with RiC as a whole as their subject — its benefits, implementing it, and how it relates to other standards. Secondly, those giving guidance on how RiC might be used in practice — examples and diagrams. Different routes through the site may be appropriate for different readers:

* For those mainly interested in high-level matters — leaders and managers for instance — the sections [int-ref](int-ref:what_are_the_benefits_of_using_ric) and [int-ref](int-ref:implementation_strategies) on the benefits of RiC, and strategies for implementing it, might be particularly relevant. These could be followed by [int-ref](int-ref:combining_ric_with_other_standards), on how RiC relates to other standards, or by browsing [int-ref](int-ref:getting_started_with_ric) or some of the FAQs, starting with [int-ref](int-ref:faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions), to become more deeply acquainted with RiC.
* For somebody learning how to use RiC in practice, perhaps with concrete modelling questions, the section [int-ref](int-ref:getting_started_with_ric), all of the FAQs (starting with [int-ref](int-ref:faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions)), and the sections [int-ref](int-ref:case_study--how_might_ric_be_of_use_to_indigenous_communities_and_other_minority_groups), and [int-ref](int-ref:extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote) might be most relevant.
    * For a beginner, we suggest to begin with [int-ref](int-ref:getting_started_with_ric), and then to browse the introductions of the FAQs, starting with [int-ref](int-ref:faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions), for indications of appropriate further material. The section [int-ref](int-ref:mappings) might be continually useful as a reference.
    * An intermediate to advanced user of RiC may wish to hop straight into some of the FAQs, the case study [int-ref](int-ref:case_study--how_might_ric_be_of_use_to_indigenous_communities_and_other_minority_groups), or the extended example [int-ref](int-ref:extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote). The modelling examples are frequently quite rich, and might have points of interest beyond the immediate matters under discussion.
* RiC and the Application Guidelines are intended for both records managers and archivists, but a few sections have a particularly records management flavour. The FAQs [int-ref](int-ref:faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions:is-ric-intended-for-records-managers-as-well-as-archivists), [int-ref](int-ref:faq--sequences), [int-ref](int-ref:faq--how_to_describe_activities_such_as_digitization_appraisal_or_disposition:appraisal-and-disposition) may especially be of interest.
* For theoreticians and others primarily interested in how RiC challenges and goes beyond traditional conceptions of archival description — whilst remaining compatible with earlier approaches — the case study [int-ref](int-ref:case_study--how_might_ric_be_of_use_to_indigenous_communities_and_other_minority_groups) may be of particular interest, perhaps followed by the extended example [int-ref](int-ref:extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote) or some of the more advanced discussion within the FAQs.
* More or less all parts of the Application Guidelines have both a digital and an analogue focus, including a mixture of examples.

Material
--------

There is currently a predominance of examples drawn from UK, Scandinavian, and Spanish material. This is an accident of circumstance rather than by design; EGAD has members from most corners of the globe, and RiC is intended to be equally applicable in diverse cultural contexts. As discussed in the [Preface](preface.html), we see the Application Guidelines as a living document; we hope that examples will be contributed from other parts of the world which we can add.

Supplementary material
----------------------

The source code for the Application Guidelines, including for all diagrams, can be found [at GitHub](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-AG). We intend to add further supporting material there as time goes on.

Providing feedback
-----------------

We welcome feedback, and encourage entering into discussion of the material in the Application Guidelines! A good place to start a discussion would be the RiC [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/Records_in_Contexts_users/). The [Issues](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-AG/issues) tab at GitHub can also be used to make suggestions and give feedback.
