# RiC-AG

This repository is dedicated to Records in Contexts Application Guidelines (RiC-AG), the fourth part of the Records in Contexts standard, whose first draft version was released on the 29th of October, 2025, at the ICA conference in Barcelona.

RiC-AG is available as a [website](https://ica-egad.github.io/RiC-AG), whose contents are contained in the `docs` directory of this repository. The other two directories contain the source documents from which the website contents are generated.

Suggestions and corrections are very welcome! They can be made in the 'Issues' tab here, or by making a post to the [RiC mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/Records_in_Contexts_users/).

The authors of the commits to this repository are merely conduits, and should not be assumed to be the actual authors of changes and additions. EGAD as a whole is the author of RiC-AG.
