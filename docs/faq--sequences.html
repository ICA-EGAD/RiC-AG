<p>We <a href="#records-in-order">begin</a> by discussing sequences of
records and how they might be modelled in RiC. We explore a simple
example, indicating along the way how correspondence might be modelled
in RiC. This section is appropriate for a beginner in RiC.</p>
<p>We then <a href="#beyond-sequence-numbers">turn</a> to a different
example, of documentation of activity in a hospital ward. We show how
the relational approach to sequences which RiC takes is flexible,
allowing for the solving of concrete problems in records management.
This section is appropriate for an intermediate to advanced user of RiC.
The use of RiC’s Activity entity (see <a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#are-activity-and-event-central-entities-in-ric-how-about-rule-and-place">§6a.3.2</a>)
to express functional provenance is also illustrated.</p>
<p>The short <a href="#not-only-chains">third section</a>, building upon
the same example, discusses the assembly of sequences into patterns
other than chains, and how RiC can handle this. It would be appropriate
for an intermediate user of RiC, or a curious beginner.</p>
<p>The <a href="#different-points-of-view">final section</a>, again
quite short, is a further elaboration upon the same example, delving a
little more deeply into what is possible in RiC. It is most appropriate
for an advanced user of RiC, or an intermediate user reasonably
comfortable with some of <a
href="faq--record_or_record_set.html">§6b</a>.</p>
<h2 data-number="6e.2" id="records-in-order"><span
class="header-section-number">6e.2</span> Records in orde<span class="end-of-section-heading">r<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>It frequently happens that records form a sequence, the order of
which it is important to preserve. Database migrations, for example,
might be stored in a directory of a digital file system, its contents
being sorted by file name; one would typically prefix these by a date,
or by increasing numbers, to ensure that the order is retained.</p>
<pre><code>001--first-migration.sql 002--second-migration.sql 003--third-migration.sql</code></pre>
<p>In a finding aid, a sequence of series might correspond to a sequence
of paragraphs within a free-text section for description of these
series. The paragraphs might be numbered — but neither this numbering or
the division of the paragraphs into a sequence are part of the
documentary structure of the finding aid.</p>
<p>This mixing of semantics might be regarded as less than ideal: should
a name not simply be a name, and a description a description?! We might
hope for specific metadata/structure for expressing that we have a
sequence.</p>
<p>Let us now focus upon correspondence between a citizen and an
official body: an initial inquiry sent by the citizen, a reply by the
official body, a response to this reply by the citizen, and so on. The
order of the copies of these records kept by the official body might be
able to be gleaned from inspection of their contents, or even just from
their form: the iterative usage in the subject line of ‘Re:’, ‘Re: Re:’,
‘Re: Re: Re:’ and so on would have been enough in the early days of
email, for instance!</p>
<p>So that we do not need to explore these records to ascertain their
order, a sequence number might be assigned to each of them. However, for
reasons we shall discuss <a href="#beyond-sequence-numbers">below</a>,
RiC instead takes the point of view that a sequence is more robustly
expressed by relations <em>between</em> records: that one record
<em>precedes or preceded</em> another (or, inversely, <em>follows or
followed</em> another). In this way, our example might be modelled as
follows — the relation <em>precedes in time</em> could have been used in
place of <em>precedes or preceded</em>.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/correspondence_sequence.svg"><img
src="diagrams/correspondence_sequence.svg"
alt="Correspondence sequence" /></a></p>
<p>RiC goes beyond older standards in its possibilities for modelling
correspondence; we might make use of this to incorporate more of the
context of the example. The fact that the sequence is defined by replies
to correspondence can be expressed using the relation <em>is reply
to</em> (or its inverse <em>has reply</em>), whilst the <em>has
addressee</em> and <em>has author</em> relations and their inverses
allow for further precision; this is illustrated below. Such an approach
would allow for searching in a precise way for a reply to a given
inquiry, or for all replies to a particular person, and so on; dates,
and more, could be included to expand the possibilities.</p>

class="header-section-number">6e.3</span> Beyond sequence number<span class="end-of-section-heading">s<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>Let us turn to a different example. In a hospital ward, at the end of
a shift, a nurse typically writes a report on each of their patients.
The collection of end-of-shift reports for a particular patient forms a
sequence of records; including some context, we might model it in RiC as
follows.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/end-of-shift_reports.svg"><img
src="diagrams/end-of-shift_reports.svg"
alt="End-of-shift reports" /></a></p>
<p>During their shift, a nurse might in addition write progress notes
for a patient; the progress notes and end-of-shift notes together also
form a sequence. If the hospital’s records managers wish to keep track
of both sequences using sequence numbers, either each end-of-shift
report must be equipped with two of them — one for the sequence
consisting only end-of-shift reports, and one for the sequence involving
both kinds of reports. Alternatively, some workaround is needed, say an
indexing syntax which takes the form S1-1, S1-2, S1-3, … and S2-1, S2-2,
S2-3, … for progress notes written during the nurse’s first and second
shifts respectively, and S1-R and S2-R for the first and second
end-of-shift reports respectively. Either way, this is quite complex,
and management of the sequences of records would be a little
fragile.</p>
<p>Progress notes for a patient written by doctors might also need to be
managed, both as a sequence on their own, and as part of a sequence
including the nurses’ progress notes and shift reports. Chaos!</p>
<p>By contrast, when expressing sequences in the way RiC does, one can
simply add extra <em>precedes or preceded</em> or <em>precedes in
time</em> relations to handle all of this, as illustrated in the
following diagram. If one is only interested in the patient’s progress
notes, one can simply ignore the end-of-shift reports and the arrows to
and from them, and vice versa.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/progress_notes_and_end-of-shift_reports.svg"><img
src="diagrams/progress_notes_and_end-of-shift_reports.svg"
alt="Progress notes and end-of-shift reports" /></a></p>
<p>In particular, RiC can, without trouble, handle multiple, parallel
sequences involving the same record resources. This is a significant
departure from older standards, where writing a finding aid would likely
necessitate choosing one sequence as primary; another sequence might
well involve the creation of a second finding aid for almost the same
record resources — this redundancy having costs both for the institution
holding the records and its users.</p>
<p>RiC’s approach also allows for flexibility in the construction of
sequences. It might be, for instance, that the nurses use an app to log
their progress notes and end-of-shift reports, but that the end-of-shift
reports are not regarded as part of a sequence within the app itself,
because they are primarily viewed by the incoming nurse immediately
after a change of shift. In other words, the situation might be as
follows in the internals of the app, with the end-of-shift reports not
related by <em>precedes or preceded</em> or <em>precedes in
time</em>.</p>
<p><a
href="diagrams/progress_notes_and_isolated_end-of-shift_reports.svg"><img
src="diagrams/progress_notes_and_isolated_end-of-shift_reports.svg"
alt="Progress notes and isolated end-of-shift reports" /></a></p>
<p>It might be only later that extra <em>precedes or preceded</em>
relations are added, say upon discharge of the patient and an archiving
of the documentation of their stay, ending up with a diagram akin to the
following.</p>
<p><a
href="diagrams/joined_progress_notes_and_end-of-shift_reports.svg"><img
src="diagrams/joined_progress_notes_and_end-of-shift_reports.svg"
alt="Joined progress notes and end-of-shift reports" /></a></p>
<p>By contrast, if one relies upon sequence numbers, any change in a
sequence — an addition or removal somewhere — would necessitate
recomputing all sequence numbers after where the change was made. This
would be the case even if one’s sequence is only a simple chain.</p>
<h2 data-number="6e.4" id="not-only-chains"><span
class="header-section-number">6e.4</span> Not only chain<span class="end-of-section-heading">s<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>Sequences of records can assemble into other shapes too; RiC can
express these equally well. Suppose, for instance, that in the time
between a nurse writing a first progress note and a later one, two
different doctors — with different fields of expertises, say — visit a
patient, and themselves each write progress notes. We might model this
as follows; in different contexts, any or all of the paths through the
diamond might be relevant.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/diamond_of_progress_notes.svg"><img
src="diagrams/diamond_of_progress_notes.svg"
alt="Diamond of progress notes" /></a></p>
<p>For a different example, a patient, following discharge, might — in
the case of recovery from a heart attack, for instance — continue to
visit a hospital periodically for physiotherapy, and separately for
clinical follow-up. These two sequences of visits might be modelled as a
bifurcation of the chain of documentation created during the patient’s
hospital stay, as in the following diagram.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/bifurcation_following_discharge.svg"><img
src="diagrams/bifurcation_following_discharge.svg"
alt="Bifurcation following discharge" /></a></p>
<h2 data-number="6e.5" id="different-points-of-view"><span

<p>Thus far we have discussed sequences of records involving a single
patient, but per-nurse sequences of records might be equally important
to manage. A nurse’s end-of-shift report encompasses all of their
patients; as discussed in <a
href="faq--record_or_record_set.html#record-within-a-record">§6b.2.5</a>,
RiC allows a Record to be included in other Records, and we might make
use of this to describe how the per-nurse and per-patient sequences
interact. The diagram below suggests one way to do it; a sequence of
records authored by Nurse 1 lies horizontally in the middle of the
diagram, whilst sequences of records for two patients, A and B, lie
above and below it.</p>
