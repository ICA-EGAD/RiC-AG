<p>This part of the Application Guidelines has several sub-parts. We
begin in <a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html">§6a</a>
on this page with some frequently asked questions about RiC in general,
before turning to some smaller modelling questions concerning RiC. In
the following sub-parts, <a
href="faq--record_or_record_set.html">§6b</a>, <a
href="faq--the_instantiation_entity.html">§6c</a>, <a
href="faq--how_to_describe_activities_such_as_digitization_appraisal_or_disposition.html">§6d</a>,
and <a href="faq--sequences.html">§6e</a>, we discuss further modelling
questions in quite some detail. The final two sub-parts give an
introduction to using vocabularies with RiC (<a
href="faq--how_to_use_ric_with_vocabularies.html">§6f</a>) and extending
RiC (<a href="faq--how_to_extend_ric.html">§6g</a>).</p>
<p>An introduction to concepts in RiC was given in <a
href="getting_started_with_ric.html">§2</a>; the answers given here are
intended to complement this and RiC-CM, offering further guidance. We
bring up subtleties and nuances which often arise upon taking RiC into
use in earnest. All of the entities in RiC-CM, and a large percentage of
the attributes and relations, are covered either on one of the pages of
the FAQ or in <a
href="extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote.html">§8</a>.</p>
<p>We encourage the modelling examples to be explored in a spirit of
reflection, to be dipped in and out of: more important than the concrete
details is the philosophy of the modelling, how the examples are
approached. How might you approach your own examples in a similar
way?</p>
<p>If at any point you feel overwhelmed, don’t forget that although the
aim in some of these FAQs, as well as in <a
href="case_study--how_might_ric_be_of_use_to_indigenous_communities_and_other_minority_groups.html">§7</a>
and in <a
href="extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote.html">§8</a>,
is to really get to the heart of what RiC can do, RiC fully allows for
more traditional methodologies to be translated into it, as discussed in
<a href="getting_started_with_ric.html">§2</a> and comprehensively
described in <a href="mappings.html">§5</a>.</p>

<h3 data-number="6a.2.1"
id="is-ric-an-officially-recommended-standard"><span
class="header-section-number">6a.2.1</span> Is RiC an officially
recommended standard?</h3>
<p>Yes, the International Council on Archives has officially recommended
RiC as a replacement for ISAD(G), ISAAR(CPF), ISDF, and ISDIAH since the
release of v1 in 2023. See <a
href="combining_ric_with_other_standards.html#the-ica-standards-ric-replaces">§4.2</a>
for a discussion of the relationship between these four standards and
RiC.</p>
<h3 data-number="6a.2.2"
id="what-is-the-relationship-between-ric-o-and-ric-cm"><span
class="header-section-number">6a.2.2</span> What is the relationship
between RiC-O and RiC-CM?</h3>
<p><a
href="https://www.ica.org/resource/records-in-contexts-conceptual-model/">RiC-CM</a>
is the primary definition of Records in Contexts. It is itself what one
might call semi-formal: some further choices are necessary to arrive at
something fully formal, for instance something which a machine can
understand and which software applications can be built upon. <a
href="https://www.ica.org/resource/records-in-contexts-ontology/">RiC-O</a>
is such a formalisation. It is an <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/RiC-O_1-1.html">ontology</a>: a
formal definition of semantics, in a language, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language">OWL</a>, made
for this purpose.</p>
<p>In addition, whilst formally transposing the entities, relations, and
attributes of RiC-CM to OWL classes, object properties, and datatype
properties, RiC-O expands RiC by adding more of these, allowing for
greater nuance, and the precise expression of aspects of archival and
records management practice which have not yet made it into RiC-CM. See
the <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/RiC-O_1-1.html#understanding-RiCO">introduction
to RiC-O</a> for a detailed overview. New versions of RiC-O are released
fairly frequently, driven by the suggestions and requests of users.
Innovations in RiC-O will likely be incorporated into future versions of
RiC-CM.</p>
<p>One can certainly, though, take RiC into use without RiC-O. On the
one hand, RiC-CM can be useful as a tool for an archivist/records
manager even without supporting software — stimulating reflection upon
internal practices, for instance. On the other, as touched upon in <a
href="implementation_strategies.html#introduce-ric-in-your-software">§3.8</a>
and <a
href="combining_ric_with_other_standards.html#ric-o-versus-eadeac-cpf">§4.4</a>,
other formalisations of RiC-CM than RiC-O should be possible.</p>
<h3 data-number="6a.2.3"
id="is-it-correct-to-describe-ric-as-a-standard-for-the-description-of-records"><span
class="header-section-number">6a.2.3</span> Is it correct to describe RiC
as a standard for the description of records?</h3>
<p>RiC can definitely be regarded as a standard for the description of
records. However, it might be most accurate to say that RiC provides a
semantics — semi-formal in the case of RiC-CM, formal in the case of
RiC-O — for archival and records management practice. It is reflecting
upon, and seeking to represent the needs and nuances of, this practice
that has driven the development of RiC. RiC’s semantics might inform and
find use in diverse aspects of archival and records management, not only
description. In addition, the fact, touched upon in <a
href="implementation_strategies.html#other-kinds-of-cultural-heritage-objects">§4.8</a>
and <a href="faq--record_or_record_set.html#record-part">§6b.2.4</a>,
that RiC allows for and encourages bridges to other domains — examples
are given in <a
href="extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote.html#broader-cultural-heritage-aspects">§8.8</a>
and <a
href="extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote.html#beyond-the-traditional-archival-context">§8.10</a>
— may open the door to other kinds of utilization than description as
conventionally understood.</p>
<h3 data-number="6a.2.4"
id="is-ric-intended-for-records-managers-as-well-as-archivists"><span
class="header-section-number">6a.2.4</span> Is RiC intended for records
managers as well as archivists?</h3>
<p>Yes! RiC is Record-centric, and is intended to provide a semantics
for the entire life of a Record. As discussed in <a
href="combining_ric_with_other_standards.html#records-management">§4.3</a>,
the standard ISO 23081 is the canonical reference for records
management, but RiC is much closer to it than earlier standards, and a
revision of ISO 23081 is planned which will take RiC into account. By
embracing use of RiC’s Activity entity, one should be able to model most
aspects of records management; see <a
href="#are-activity-and-event-central-entities-in-ric-how-about-rule-and-place">below</a>
and <a
href="faq--how_to_describe_activities_such_as_digitization_appraisal_or_disposition.html">§6d</a>
for more on this, and <a href="faq--sequences.html">§6e</a> for a
particularly relevant part of the Application Guidelines. Specific
semantics are available for many aspects of records management, all the
more so in RiC-O. EGAD is is open to adding more in future versions of
RiC, according to the needs and requests of users.</p>
<h3 data-number="6a.2.5"
id="will-an-analogue-of-the-tool-atom-be-developed-for-ric"><span
class="header-section-number">6a.2.5</span> Will an analogue of the tool
Atom be developed for RiC?</h3>
<p>The development of software to support working with RiC is beyond the
direct scope of EGAD itself, though we are actively working to support
initiatives in this direction. Atom too was developed outside of the
committee responsible for ISAD(G) and its companion standards. It takes
time for the influence of new standards to be felt, and EGAD has a firm
belief that software with comprehensive support for RiC will arrive in
due course — some already exists commercially, whilst freely available
tools are beginning to be developed. Keep an eye on the RiC <a
href="https://ica-egad.github.io/RiC-ResourceList/">Resource List</a>,
which is intended, amongst other things, to serve as a hub for
developments in this area.</p>
<p>A technical barrier — not necessarily insurmountable — to simply
further developing Atom to support RiC is that natural data formats for
RiC, such as RDF, OWL and variants, are not necessarily immediately
well-suited to the relational database infrastructure underlying Atom;
see <a
href="implementation_strategies.html#map-your-legacy-data-to-ric">§3.6</a>
and <a
href="implementation_strategies.html#introduce-ric-in-your-software">§3.8</a>
for a little more on this. There are also funding obstacles.</p>
<p>Modern software usually is built around APIs for programmatic
handling of data. It is possible that providing such APIs for use with
RiC might be more appropriate and fruitful in today’s open-source
ecosystem than development of a full-scale application akin to Atom. At
minimum, though, it will be necessary construct tools for translating
data in Atom databases to RiC.</p>

question<span class="end-of-section-heading">s<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<h3 data-number="6a.3.1"
id="is-describing-the-content-of-a-record-within-rics-domain"><span
class="header-section-number">6a.3.1</span> Is describing the content of
a Record within RiC’s domain?</h3>
<p>The tasks of archivists and records managers might be said to
primarily concern the handling of records — with its many facets —
rather than detailed interaction with the contents of those records,
this being carried out by users of records. Nevertheless, there is far
from a complete divide.</p>
<p>Firstly, modelling content in a structured way enriches the
description of a record, placing it into a richer context, this
facilitating its discovery; broadening the understanding of its
provenance; and opening the door to any number of connections between
fields, serendipitous or sought after. RiC-CM includes various
attributes and relations to this end, the Scope and content attribute
and <em>has or had subject</em> relation, for instance; whilst RiC-O
also includes for example <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/RiC-O_1-1.html#hasContentWhichRepresents">rico:hasContentWhichRepresents</a>
and <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/RiC-O_1-1.html#sentimentOrEmotionExpressed">rico:sentimentOrEmotionExpressed</a>,
with further developments likely. In addition, RiC fully allows for
other standards to take over at the boundaries of RiC, as we discussed
<a
href="is-it-correct-to-describe-ric-as-a-standard-for-the-description-of-records">above</a>.</p>
<p>Secondly, certain aspects of a record’s content can be of importance
for the handling of a record. If, for instance, a record’s content is
deemed sensitive, offensive, or inappropriate in any other way, one
might make use of a Rule to express this as suggested below; the
releavant content of the Record is not modelled explicitly, only
referred to in free-text, although one could certainly do this using
Record Part.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/record_with_sensitive_content.svg"><img
src="diagrams/record_with_sensitive_content.svg"
alt="Record with sensitive content" /></a></p>
<p>As an aside, whilst the History attribute is used in the modelling
above for simplicity, one might model this kind of meta-metadata,
i.e. the reason something appears in a description, using — as suggested
in Chapter 6 of RiC-CM and discussed in more detail <a
href="do-you-have-examples-illustrating-chapter-6-of-ric-cm">below</a> —
a Record, the content of which might be along the lines of the History
attribute above, but which would in addition facilitate expressing in a
structured way who made the judgement of offensiveness, when it was
made, and so on.</p>
<p><a
href="diagrams/record_with_sensitive_content_more_structured.svg"><img
src="diagrams/record_with_sensitive_content_more_structured.svg"
alt="Record with sensitive content, more structured" /></a></p>
<h3 data-number="6a.3.2"
id="are-activity-and-event-central-entities-in-ric-how-about-rule-and-place"><span
class="header-section-number">6a.3.2</span> Are Activity and Event
central entities in RiC? How about Rule and Place?</h3>
<p>In short: yes, they are all regarded as central entities! Earlier
standards including entities somewhat akin Activity, such as ISDF, have
not been broadly adopted, although activities themselves are implicit
all function-based classification schemes, which are widespread. The
scope of Activity is much broader in RiC than in these previous
standards, though: it may be used to refer to archival practices and
processes; it may be used to indicate functional provenance; or it may
be used to refer to external happenings of relevance to the archival
context. See the introduction to <a
href="faq--how_to_describe_activities_such_as_digitization_appraisal_or_disposition.html">§6d</a>
for links to examples of all of these kinds of usage in the Application
Guidelines. In many ways, Activity and Event might be said to be the
glue that makes RiC what it is, when it is fully embraced.</p>
<p>This is of course not to say that you cannot express what you want in
RiC without Activity or Event; you certainly can! See <a
href="getting_started_with_ric.html">§2</a> for a typical example in
which Activity or Event are hardly present; migrations from ISAD(G) or
other earlier standards along the lines suggested in <a
href="mappings.html">§5</a> may well not use Activity or Event to begin
with. It is more when the philosophy of RiC has begun to impress itself
upon one that Activity or Event will likely enter the stage!</p>
<p>The Rule and Mandate entities, if perhaps not quite as widely
applicable as Activity or Event, can also be made use of in all kinds of
archival and records management settings, those pertaining to conditions
of access for instance. In addition, of course, external laws,
regulations, and societal mores frequently are important aspects of the
context of a Record Resource. See <a
href="faq--how_to_describe_activities_such_as_digitization_appraisal_or_disposition.html#appraisal-and-disposition">§6d.3</a>
for an example where the Rule and Mandate entities are fundamental to
the context.</p>
<p>The Place entity often plays an important role in binding together
aspects of context: see <a
href="record_or_record_set.html#invasion-of-norway-in-1940">§6b.4.2</a>
and <a
href="extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote.html">§8</a>
for example. RiC sees Places as having a dynamic, geopolitical
character; their changes through time can be a significant and
enlightenting, if non-traditional, perspective from which to approach
records.</p>
<h3 data-number="6a.3.3"
id="can-you-elaborate-upon-the-difference-between-activity-and-event"><span
class="header-section-number">6a.3.3</span> Can you elaborate upon the
difference between Activity and Event?</h3>
<p>In RiC, an Activity is a special case of an Event. As an initial
guide, it is quite likely that you have an Activity, and that this
should be used. It is easy to be a little tricked by ordinary language,
coming to a quick conclusion that something might be more of a one-off
event than an activity, but RiC-CM stresses that an Event might very
well be a continuous endeavour that lasts a period of time. The key
sentence in RiC-CM, in §2.2.4, is that an Activity is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an agent-designed and performed event that has an intended purpose or
purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost any aspect of archival and records management practice —
digitization, accrual, appraisal, description, curation, and so on —
will likely fall under this.</p>
<p>A typical use of an Event which is not an Activity would be in
connection with <em>is associated with event</em>, <em>has or had
subject</em>, or <em>has or had main subject</em>, namely relating a
Record or Record Set to a certain moment of history, seen in our context
as an abstract point of reference, i.e. we disregard its performance and
purpose; <a
href="https://discover.york.ac.uk/collections/halifax-diaries/?m=2&amp;cv=42">Lord
Halifax’s diaries</a> might be said relate to the Event of the Second
World War, without being regarded as documenting it as such — an
Activity which they document is Lord Halifax’s carrying out of his
governmental and private duties. Such Events are very useful for placing
a Record Resource in a rich thematic context, facilitating for instance
their discovery. Further examples of the Event vs Activity distinction
are given in <a
href="case_study--how_might_ric_be_of_use_to_indigenous_communities_and_other_minority_groups.html#incorporating-map-data-into-a-sámi-context">§7.4</a>
and <a href="faq--record_or_record_set.html#minute-books">§6b.4</a>.</p>
<h3 data-number="6a.3.4"
id="do-you-have-examples-illustrating-chapter-6-of-ric-cm"><span
class="header-section-number">6a.3.4</span> Do you have examples
illustrating Chapter 6 of RiC-CM?</h3>
<p>The focus of Chapter 6 in RiC-CM is upon meta-metadata, the principal
theme being that RiC has a certain self-reflexivity: it can be used to
speak about itself — to elaborate upon modelling choices in a structured
way. To achieve this, one approach, where a single relation or attribute
has been chosen, might be to interpolate with Activity, Event, and
Record entities and relations. An example of this approach is given
above <a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#is-describing-the-content-of-a-record-within-rics-domain">§6a.3.1</a>;
see also <a
href="faq--record_or_record_set.html#databases">§6b.5</a>.</p>
<p>One also has the attributes of relations in §5.5 of RiC-CM,
implemented as sub-classes of the <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/RiC-O_1-1.html#Relation">rico:Relation</a>
class in RiC-O. Although it may at first seem a distinct mechanism, use
of these attributes is in fact very similar to the interpolation
approach, albeit that the latter is more general, and typically more
flexible. In future, the two techniques may be formally unified.</p>
<p>Recording of meta-metadata is important in settings where artifical
intelligence is used; it is sometimes referred to as paradata in this
context. The diagram below indicates how this might be modelled in the
case of transcription of handwritten parish register using AI. Instead
of the single <em>has or had derived instantiation</em> relation, a
number of Activity and other entities are involved. More could of course
be included. Standards developed specifically for the purpose might be
used to form the content of the Records documenting the two Activities
in the modelling.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/artifical_intelligence_transcription.svg"><img
src="diagrams/artificial_intelligence_transcription.svg"
alt="Transcription using artificial intelligence" /></a></p>
<p>As a second example, a generative AI chatbot might be used to create
an overview of the contents of a Record, to be used as part of a
description of that Record. This might be modelled as follows, the
prompt given to the chatbot being an important piece of
meta-metadata/paradata in such cases. Again, more could be included.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/generative_chatbot.svg"><img
src="diagrams/generative_chatbot.svg"
alt="Archival description using generative chatbot" /></a></p>
<h3 data-number="6a.3.5"
id="my-archival-institution-holds-fragments-of-medieval-documents-how-might-ric-model-this"><span
class="header-section-number">6a.3.5</span> My archival institution holds
fragments of medieval documents, how might RiC model this?</h3>
<p>An example are fragments at the Norwegian National Archives of a
manuscript containing <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostating_Law">Frostatingsloven</a>,
pictured <a
href="https://www.arkivverket.no/utforsk-arkivene/skole/historiske-kilder/middelalder-i-norge/frostatingsloven">here</a>.
In RiC, a Record (RiC-E04) is not required to have an extant
Instantiation (RiC-E06), only to have once had one. Thus each fragment
can be modelled as a Record Part (RiC-E05) with a still-extant
Instantiation, components of a now-lost Instantiation of a Record.</p>
<p>A somewhat tricky aspect is how exactly to define this Record: what
does it document? Why are the fragments held in an archival institution?
There exist discussions of these matters in the literature, which it
would take us too far afield to enter into; as ever, the context in
which one approaches the questions is crucial. For simplicity, let us
regard the original manuscript as a Record of propagation of
Frostatingsloven in the 1300s.</p>
<p>There do exist (complete) transcriptions of Frostatingsloven from the
1600s. We include one of these in the modelling too, viewing it as an
Instantiation of a copy of the Record in question; given that we taking
the Record to be documenting the propagating of Frostatingsloven, rather
than Frostatingsloven itself as an abstract, non-written conception, it
would not be correct to regard it as an Instantiation of the original
Record itself — as discussed in <a
href="faq--the_instantiation_entity.html#when-does-a-derived-instantiation-represent-a-new-record">§6c.3</a>,
one might regard it as representing a Record in its own right, but we
omit to take this into consideration here.</p>
