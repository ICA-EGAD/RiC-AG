<p>This FAQ offers some food for thought and advice for people who would
like to extend RiC — whether RiC-CM or RiC-O. That is to say, to add
components to RiC that you need for your descriptions.</p>
<h2 data-number="6g.2" id="why-extend-ric"><span
class="header-section-number">6g.2</span> Why extend RiC<span class="end-of-section-heading">?<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>RiC is a generic, international, standard; it might be necessary to
extend it to meet local requirements. In addition, RiC-CM is a reference
framework, without the level of granularity that might be necessary to,
say, precisely describe special collections — sets of medieval charters,
postcards, or notarial acts, for instance — precisely, or to meet the
very specific needs of researchers. As the introduction to RiC-CM puts
it in 1.2 Purpose and Scope:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a high-level model, RiC-CM is a broad conceptual framework. It
does not address the full range of activities needed to manage records,
nor does it address the full detail that may be required in any possible
context in which it may be applied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>RiC-O offers a richer arsenal than RiC-CM; it currently has 107
classes, 75 datatype properties, and 480 object properties, as presented
in its <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/RiC-O_1-1.html#history-note">history
note</a>. Nevertheless, the ontology cannot anticipate all use cases and
all current and future needs, though suggestions for additions are
always welcome.</p>
<p>Furthermore, RiC is a recent standard. Version 1.0 of RiC-CM and
version 1.1 of RiC-O are themselves the result of enhancements to
previous versions. Though they constitute a coherent whole, at this
stage of its history, RiC is not as complete as one might hope in an
ideal world, or as it will be in the future.</p>
<h2 data-number="6g.3" id="is-your-journey-necessary"><span
class="header-section-number">6g.3</span> Is your journey necessary<span class="end-of-section-heading">?<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>Developing an extension to RiC involves defining additional entities,
attributes, or relations — or, in the case of RiC-O, additional classes
or properties — to complete the model. This requires thought, testing,
formalization, and time. Once the extension is developed, it must be
implemented in practice; in some cases, albeit somewhat unlikely today,
there not yet being a profusion of software for RiC, this may involve
adapting a pre-existing, RiC-compliant, tool. The extension must then be
maintained, and if RiC evolves, you may need to update it
accordingly.</p>
<p>Thus, before embarking upon such an initiative, it’s a good idea to
verify that your extension really is necessary in your institution or
for your project!</p>
<p>If RiC-CM doesn’t include the additional entity, attribute, or
relation you would like, check to see if RiC-O offers it. Here are some
examples of RiC-O components that currently don’t appear in any form in
RiC-CM, and which concern Record Resources or Instantiations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the classes <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Title">rico:Title</a>,
<a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#IdentifierType">rico:IdentifierType</a>,
<a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#TitleType">rico:TitleType</a>;
the properties <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#title">rico:title</a>,
<a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#hasIdentifierType">rico:hasIdentifierType</a>,
<a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#hasTitleType">rico:hasTitleType</a>,
and their inverse properties;</p></li>
<li><p>several object properties which are sub-properties of <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#includesOrIncluded">rico:includesOrIncluded</a>,
like <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#included">rico:included</a>;</p></li>
<li><p>several object properties which have domain <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Date">rico:Date</a>,
e.g. <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#isDerivationDateOf">rico:isDerivationDateOf</a>,
<a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#isMigrationDateOf">rico:isMigrationDateOf</a>,
<a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#isAccumulationDateOf">rico:isAccumulationDateOf</a>,
<a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#isDestructionDateOf">rico:isDestructionDateOf</a>,
<a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#isPublicationDateOf">rico:isPublicationDateOf</a>,
and their inverse properties;</p></li>
<li><p>several object properties and datatype useful to represent
sequences (see <a href="faq--sequences.html">§6e</a> for more on these)
and hierarchies of record resources, such as the ones defined as
sub-properties of <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#precedesOrPreceded">rico:precedesOrPreceded</a>,
and also <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/RiC-O_1-1.html#wasMergedInto">rico:wasMergedInto</a>
and <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/RiC-O_1-1.html#wasSplitInto">rico:wasSplitInto</a>,
as well as the inverse properties of all of these;</p></li>
<li><p>several object properties which are subproperties of <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#hasOrHadSubject">rico:hasOrHadSubject</a>,
such as <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#hasContentWhichRepresents">rico:hasContentWhichRepresents</a>;</p></li>
<li><p>the <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#recordResourceHasSourceOfInformation">rico:recordResourceHasSourceOfInformation</a>
object property;</p></li>
<li><p>datatype properties related to the dimensions of things, such as
<a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#width">rico:width</a>
or <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#height">rico:height</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you find any of these RiC-O components useful, then when
developing an extension for RiC-CM, you can draw inspiration from them
and, whenever possible, explicitly establish a correspondence in your
extension between components you add and existing components in
RiC-O.</p>
<p>Check toothat there are no other models that meet your needs, whose
scope would be complementary to that of RiC, and that you could use in
combination with RiC. For more on this, see <a
href="combining_ric_with_other_standards.html">§4</a> and <a
href="faq--how_to_use_ric_with_vocabularies.html#skos-vocabularies-to-populate-classes-in-ric-o-datasets">§6f.3</a>.</p>
<p>Here are two examples of existing projects that have combined RiC and
other models:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="https://francearchives.gouv.fr/">FranceArchives (FA)
portal</a> team has semanticized, in accordance with RiC-O 0.2, all the
archival metadata that this portal aggregates; see <a
href="https://francearchives.gouv.fr/fr/article/756183859">this page</a>
(in French). Since FranceArchives also manages specific data, such as
opening hours and contact details, on French archival institutions that
provide finding aids to the portal, the FA team had to find a solution
to structuring this data, since RiC-O does not provide properties for
this. It was decided to use a few properties defined in <a
href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>, including <a
href="https://schema.org/openingHours">schema:openingHours</a> and <a
href="https://schema.org//openingHours">schema:telephone</a>, as well as
the class <a
href="https://schema.org/PostalAddress">schema:PostalAddress</a>. See
for example <a href="https://francearchives.gouv.fr/service/33862">this
description</a> of a French territorial archives service, the ‘Archives
départementales de la Mayenne’.</p>
<p>Note that this implies that such an archival service, initially
defined as an instance of the <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#CorporateBody">rico:CorporateBody</a>
class, also can be considered an instance of the Schema.org <a
href="https://schema.org/LocalBusiness">Local Business</a> or <a
href="https://schema.org/CivicStructure">Civic Structure</a> class,
since the union of these two is the domain of <a
href="https://schema.org/openingHours">schema:openingHours</a> and <a
href="https://schema.org//openingHours">schema:telephone</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://memoriav.ch/fr/memobase">Memobase
portal</a>, which aggregates data about audiovisual cultural heritage in
Switzerland, uses RiC-O 0.2 as its main reference ontology, completed by
properties defined by <a href="https://www.rdaregistry.info/">the RDA
registry</a>, and by properties defined by <a
href="https://tech.ebu.ch/metadata/ebucore">EBUCore</a>, an ontology
developed by The European Broadcasting Union, an alliance of public
service media. See the <a
href="https://ub-basel.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MD/pages/336855177/Memobase+RDF">documentation</a>of
the Memobase data model, particularly the list of properties for digital
instantiations, such as ebucore:duration or
ebucore:mediaResourceDescription.</p></li>

<p>If your needs seem to be of quite general interest and might be
shared by others, you are very welcome to contact EGAD; we would be
happy to discuss them with you. You might contact EGAD in one of the
ways indicated below, explaining what you would need; and then EGAD will
see if RiC can be enriched so that your need is addressed.</p>
<p>This is how, alongside other processes, RiC-O has evolved over the
past few years. Here are two examples, among several others, of
developments requested by users, and publicly discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <a
href="https://groups.google.com/g/Records_in_Contexts_users/c/yYQFdlDcPBQ">discussion</a>
on the RiC users list in August 2024 resulted in the creation of several
properties, used to link a <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Record">rico:Record</a>
or a <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#RecordPart">rico:RecordPart</a>
to a thing it represents or an emotion expressed — see <a
href="https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/pull/138">the pull
request</a>;</p></li>
<li><p>an issue created on GitHub in November 2024 about adding a
property to link a student and the organization at which they studied,
resulted in the creation of two properties and one class — see <a
href="https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/issues/125">the issue</a> and
the <a href="https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/pull/129">resulting pull
request</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Do not hesitate to create issues on GitHub, comment on issues, and
make pull requests. EGAD may need time to think about your problems and
proposals, make a decision and carry out the necessary work, so it is
possible that you will have to extend RiC-CM or RiC-O in the meantime.
But taking the step of contacting EGAD might benefit both your
organization and the the whole community, either immediately or over
time!</p>
<h2 data-number="6g.5"
id="if-you-decide-to-develop-an-extension-a-few-recommendations"><span
class="header-section-number">6g.5</span> If you decide to develop an

<p>As the additional components you need are not included in RiC, they
should be clearly declared as such: create your own list of additional
entities, attributes and relations (or classes and properties), in a
distinct model (resp. or ontology) which would have its own identifier
and name (resp. URI and namespace prefix). Equip each component which
you add with its own name and identifier too (resp. its own URI).</p>
<p>Given that you are constructing an extension of RiC, the next step
would be to define your new components as sub-entities, sub-attributes,
sub-relations, of an entity, an attribute or a relation of RiC-CM (resp.
sub-classes or sub-properties of an existing component of RiC-O). It is
worth taking the time to ask yourself and reflect upon precisely which
existing component in RiC could be this attachment point; the extension
must be consistent with the semantics and hierarchies provided by
RiC.</p>
<p>Let us consider a very simple example. Suppose you are describing a
set of notarial records, including many wills, and that you need to
record the relations that exist between these Records and People or
Corporate bodies very accurately. In particular, you wish to record that
a given person is the testator of a given will, so that later, end users
can query the data, asking say: “give me the names of the testators of
the wills that are dated within some given date range and/or held by
some institution”.</p>
<p>Neither RiC-CM nor RiC-O provides a relation or property to record
such a fact, or address this specific need, nor is likely to do so soon.
For RiC is not a model about wills, nor about the roles of the
individuals involved, it is about records in general and their context
entities. If you need to express the situation, and if RiC is your main
reference model, this is a good reason to extend RiC.</p>
<p>Start by looking amongst the RiC relations for one that you are
confident is broader than your ‘has testator’ relation. There is, for
instance, a <em>has author</em> relation in RiC-CM, and a corresponding
property in RiC-O, <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#hasAuthor">rico:hasAuthor</a>.
This relation is defined as follows in RiC-O, and it’s just the same in
RiC-CM.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Label(s): a pour responsable intellectuel (fr) | has author (en) |
tiene como autor a (es)</p>
<p>Definition: Connects a Record to the Group, Person or Position that
is responsible for conceiving and formulating the information contained
in the Record.</p>
<p>Scope note: To be used for a Person, Group or Position that makes any
contribution to the content of a record. Includes the Person, Group or
Position in whose name or by whose command the content may have been
formulated and first instantiated (for example the Person who signed the
Record).</p>
<p>Has super-properties: rico:hasCreator</p>
<p>Has domain: rico:Record</p>
<p>Has range: rico:Group or rico:Person or rico:Position</p>
<p>Has inverse: rico:isAuthorOf</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The definition and scope note here encompass, broadly speaking, ‘has
testator’. Whether the will was created by the testator’s hand then
deposited within the records of a notary, or by a third party (for
example a notary), its content is defined by the testator and the
testator’s signature attests to this, i.e. is a kind of authorship.</p>
<p>The ‘has testator’ relation you want to create could therefore be
declared as a sub-relation or sub-property <em>has author</em>. It would
always have a Person as its source, this being consistent with the
domain of <em>has author</em> relation, which is a union of Group,
Person, and Position. The relation would have a will as its target,
which can be considered a kind of Record, and thus everything is fine —
there is no logical inconsistency between RiC and your proposal. You’ve
found a good solution!</p>
<p>If you decide to define a conceptual model for your project, you will
define the <em>has testator</em> relation there, giving it a clear
textual definition, maybe a scope note. You would specify that this
relation has domain RiC-CM Person, and target RiC-CM Record.</p>
<p>If you decide to define an ontology for your project, named say “An
ontology for notarial records held by my institution”, you will need to
assign a URI to it,
e.g. ‘http://myinstitution.org/projects/notarialRecords/ontology’, as
well, possibly, as a preferred namespace prefix, such as ‘my-onto’. You
would define the <em>has testator</em> relation in the ontology, giving
it a URI derived from the one for the ontology, say
‘http://myinstitution.org/projects/notarialRecords/ontology#hasTestator’),
and then, again, a clear textual definition and a scope note. You would
specify that this relation has domain rico:Person and range rico:Record.
All this might result in the following lines (in Turtle syntax):</p>

<p>If you use this extension, and thus create triples in your dataset
whose predicate is ‘my-onto:hasTestator’, a reasoner will be able to
infer from each such triple one where the ‘my-onto:hasTestator’
predicate is replaced by <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#hasAuthor">rico:hasAuthor</a>;
and that the target of the triple is a <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Record">rico:Record</a>,
its source a <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Person">rico:Person</a>.</p>
<p>We recommend that you use an OWL 2 ontology editor, it will likely be
very useful to you. The open source <a
href="https://protege.stanford.edu/software.php#desktop-protege">Protégé
Desktop software</a>, for example, can display your extension and the
original model extended in the same window (if you have imported the
latter), so that you can see where the components are declared in the
RiC-O hierarchy. Such tools typically embed reasoners which can check
that there is no logical inconsistency in what you have asserted, as
well as infer triples.</p>
<p>If you clearly document the extension you have defined, and publish
it under a permissive licence along with the data using the components
you have added, this will enable others to reuse your data,
understanding its semantics. They will also enable the production from
your dataset of one which is strictly compliant to RiC-O, i.e. not an
extension, since the components you have defined are sub-properties or
sub-classes of RiC-O. Portals or aggregators might for instance wish to
gather datasets using RiC-O only, not taking into account extensions; or
they might also be interested in your extension, and reuse it.</p>
<p>In the end, all of this might influence the development of RiC
itself.</p>
