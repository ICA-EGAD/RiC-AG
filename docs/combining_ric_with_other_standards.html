<p>As discussed in the introduction to <a
href="https://www.ica.org/resource/records-in-contexts-conceptual-model/">RiC-CM</a>,
Records in Contexts is designed for working intellectually with records
and contexts of records. Its main focus is not upon other aspects of
records — their storage, materiality, or preservation, for instance;
upon other types of cultural heritage material such as books or
artworks; or upon detailed description of people, places, and other
entities. Nevertheless, RiC can be combined with standards for these
domains and others. Introducing this topic will be the focus of the
second half of this part of the Application Guidelines.</p>
<p>In addition, RiC relates to other standards for archival description
and records management. We will begin here, touching upon both standards
of a more conceptual nature and technical standards which can complement
the structured, machine-readable descriptions that are possible with
RiC-O.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.2" id="the-ica-standards-ric-replaces"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2</span> The ICA standards RiC
replace<span class="end-of-section-heading">s<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>As touched upon in the earlier parts of the Application Guidelines,
RiC replaces ISAD(G), ISAAR(CPF), ISDF and ISDIAH, combining and
significantly extending the ability to describe archival resources,
actors, functions and archival institutions that using these earlier
standards gave. Though RiC differs significantly from these standards
both concretely and conceptually, it is backwards compatible with them.
In <a href="getting_started_with_ric.html">§2</a>, we explored in detail
an example of moving from a description made in accordance with these
earlier standards to a RiC description. A full crosswalk is presented in
<a href="mappings.html">§5</a>. There is not always a unique way to
adapt a description based upon these standards to RiC, but there is
always some way to do it.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.3" id="records-management"><span
class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Records managemen<span class="end-of-section-heading">t<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>Records in Contexts is greatly inspired by, and closely related to,
the standard <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/73172.html">ISO
23081</a> (Information and documentation – Records management processes
– Metadata for records) for describing and managing records. The
relation between the two is described in section 1.6.3 of RiC-CM. It
states that the difference is that RiC-CM defines how to capture</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the metadata used to describe, control, and enable access to records
of enduring value that are identified for ongoing preservation by an
archival program</p>
</blockquote>
<p>whilst the focus of ISO 23081 is upon</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the metadata that is needed to protect, understand, and enable the
usability of records as evidence from the point of creation by records
creators and for as long as the records need to be retained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Records in Contexts can be helpful in implementing the ISO 23081
standard. It is a significant step forward in this respect from ISAD(G)
and its accompanying standards, closing the gap between ‘old’ and ‘new’
archives. The three entities of people, records and mandates in ISO
23081 are included in RiC, enabling both archivists and records managers
to use the same general framework.</p>
<p>RiC, though, introduces further entities, enabling more precise
description of records than is possible in ISO 23081, in particular
additional metadata concerning the provenance and history of records and
their descriptions. The standardizing committee of ISO 23081 and EGAD
intends to iron out the (subtle, where the two overlap) differences
between the two standards in future versions of them.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.4" id="ric-o-versus-eadeac-cpf"><span
class="header-section-number">4.4</span> RiC-O versus EAD/EAC-CP<span class="end-of-section-heading">F<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>In RiC, we distinguish between a conceptual model and the way
metadata is stored or disseminated. For the latter purpose, we provide
the ontology <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology">RiC-O</a> to allow for
expressing RiC metadata in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a>
triples — we feel this fits the networked, open-ended nature of RiC
particularly well. As discussed in <a
href="implementation_strategies.html#introduce-ric-in-your-software">§3.8</a>,
though, it should also be possible to make use of a relational or NoSQL
database instead.</p>
<p>Over the past few decades, many people have made use of the Encoded
Archival Description (EAD) XML standard for descriptive data, in
conjunction with the Encoded Archival Context for Corporate Bodies,
Persons and Families (EAC-CPF) XML standard. RiC-O serves the purpose of
both standards, namely the capturing of data about Record Resources and
Agents respectively.</p>
<p>New versions, EAD4 and EAC-CPF, of the two Encoded Archival Standards
are expected to be released in the summer of 2026, along with a new XML
schema, EAC-F, for functions. They will place greater emphasis upon
rich, detailed descriptions of entities such as record resources,
instantiations, agents, and functions/activities. Relations between
these entities will be represented more comprehensively, both
structurally and semantically.</p>
<p>The design and naming of relations in these new versions is inspired
by RiC-O, ensuring conceptual alignment. Looking beyond their release,
the plan is to focus development upon deeper integration and
harmonization with related standards such as RiC, to foster a more
consistent and interoperable metadata ecosystem.</p>
<p>A mapping between RiC and EAD is provided in <a
href="mappings.html">§5</a>.</p>
<p>The nature of the EAD XML schema is such that if you use it to
represent RiC-CM-based metadata, you may feel a need to duplicate some
parts of a description. We suggest you try to avoid this as far as
possible, or at least to create links with locally unique identifiers
between EAD components describing the same record resource.</p>
<p>Whatever technology you choose, we recommend that, in line with
RiC-CM, you create separate descriptions for agents, events, activities,
rules and places, pointing to them from your record resource
descriptions. This might be by means of authority records; by using
separate tables within a relational database; by using unique
identifiers in EAD/EAC-CPF; or by using Uniform Resource Identifiers
(URIs) in RiC-O.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.5" id="digital-preservation"><span

<p>For digital storage in the long-term, specific, mostly technical,
metadata is needed. Attributes and relations to this end are
intentionally not provided in RiC, but are well defined in <a
href="https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/">PREMIS</a>, which provides
a standard for</p>
<blockquote>
<p>metadata to support the preservation of digital objects and ensure
their long-term usability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alignment between PREMIS and RiC-CM, and between RiC-O and the PREMIS
ontology, is planned as part of EGAD’s future work.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.6" id="specific-aspects-of-context-entities"><span
class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Specific aspects of context

<p>Many record resources relate to persons, places, subject matter,
events and the like. Sometimes your local culture will necessitate
specific metadata structures to sufficiently capture these. In the
Netherlands and Germany, for instance, a family name could consist of a
prefix (‘von’) that must be separable from the rest of the family name.
Addresses might have a particular structure in your country. RiC is
extensible: it should be possible to apply an appropriate standard for
your use case on top of RiC. In particular, controlled vocabularies,
often expressed using <a
href="https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a>, can be used alongside
RiC. We refer to <a
href="faq--how_to_use_ric_with_vocabularies.html">§6f</a> for more on
this.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.7" id="datasets"><span
class="header-section-number">4.7</span> Dataset<span class="end-of-section-heading">s<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>The concept of a ‘dataset’ can be useful, whether to refer to the
content of a Record Resource — data collected by an organisation or for
an academic project, say; or to metadata offering access points into a
set of records; or to a selection of metadata describing records
themselves which is organised into a single entity. Depending on the
nature of the data and the context in which they are described, datasets
can be considered a Record or a Record Set. See <a
href="faq--record_or_record_set.html">§6b</a> for a discussion of this
kind of judgement.</p>
<p>Certain kinds of metadata might be appropriate for datasets, and
collections of them, specifically. Two standards for this are the Data
Catalog Vocabulary (<a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">DCAT</a>) and the Vocabulary of
Interlinked Datasets (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/void/">VoID</a>).
They are used to describe the origin, contexts, accessibility and
usability of in this case digital and structured data. According to its
documentation, DCAT</p>
<blockquote>
<p>enables a publisher to describe datasets and data services in a
catalog using a standard model and vocabulary that facilitates the
consumption and aggregation of metadata from multiple catalogs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst VOID is aimed towards RDF datasets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is an RDF Schema vocabulary that provides terms and patterns for
describing RDF datasets, and is intended as a bridge between the
publishers and users of RDF data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We suggest to investigate whether these standards might be applicable
to your use case alongside RiC. When viewing a dataset as a Record
Resource, RiC can be used for archival and records management aspects,
whilst a dataset standard can be used for dataset-specific aspects of
content, provenance, or aggregation.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.8"
id="other-kinds-of-cultural-heritage-objects"><span
class="header-section-number">4.8</span> Other kinds of cultural

<p>Archives are considered cultural heritage, as are — in some contexts
— books, artworks, archeological findings, site, and built monuments.
The concepts of RiC are approached from the point of view of description
of records; other domains have their own conceptualizations, also of
records in some cases, appropriate to the specificities of their own
domains. If you wish to relate your records to other kinds of cultural
heritage material or perspectives, standards exist which can be used
along with RiC. We cannot give a complete overview, but will give brief
descriptions of a few in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>The library community is organized by the International Federation of
Library Associations (IFLA). They have set up a committee that
standardized the <a
href="https://repository.ifla.org/handle/20.500.14598/40.2">Library
Reference Model</a> (LRM), a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>model that covers all aspects of bibliographic data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also relevant is the <a
href="https://www.rdatoolkit.org/about">Resource Description and
Access</a> (RDA) standard, a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>package of data elements, guidelines, and instructions for creating
library and cultural heritage resource metadata that are well-formed
according to international models for user-focused linked data
applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the museum community, the <em>Comité International pour la
Documentation</em> (CIDOC), part of the International Council of Museums
(ICOM), has developed the <a href="https://cidoc-crm.org/">Conceptual
Reference Model</a> (CRM), mostly known as CIDOC-CRM. It contains</p>
<blockquote>
<p>definitions and a formal structure for describing the implicit and
explicit concepts and relationships used in cultural heritage
documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst a careful relating of RiC and CIDOC-CRM remains for the
future, experience suggests that descriptions expressed in RiC can be
mapped to CIDOC-CRM, but with considerable loss of specificity: RiC is a
domain standard, whilst CIDOC-CRM is a general cultural heritage/human
knowledge framework at quite a high level of abstraction. The <a
href="https://linked.art/">Linked Art</a> community has followed this
template, building upon CIDOC-CRM to create a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>shared model … to describe cultural heritage, with a focus on artwork
but also including archives and bibliographic material.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the data level, in line with the Linked Data philosophy, RDF
enables you to link, by means of its URI, a description in RiC-O to the
description of a cultural heritage object described in another
formalised conceptual model. This might for instance be useful when an
artwork or book is part of an archive, but needs to be described in an
artistic or bibliographic context; or to describe the content of an
artwork or publication held as a Record. It is possible to combine the
classes and properties of RiC-O and those of RDA or CIDOC-CRM to
describe a cultural object as, say, being both a LRM Expression and a
RiC Record.</p>
<p>We give a couple of examples of this kind of interaction in <a
href="extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote.html#broader-cultural-heritage-aspects">§8.8</a>
and <a
href="extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote.html#beyond-the-traditional-archival-context">§8.10</a>.</p>

<p>In some cases, it might be necessary or useful to provide less
complex metadata than RiC allows for, using a more general standard,
such as <a
href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/">Dublin
Core</a>, <a href="https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html">Schema.org</a>,
or the <a
href="https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation">Europeana Data
Model</a> (EDM). Mapping between RiC and these standards has not yet
been carried out, but it is possible in practice, at least in specific
cases. Whilst such standards cannot play the role RiC does, transforming
your RiC metadata to them and publishing it as an extra service might
facilitate interoperability.</p>
