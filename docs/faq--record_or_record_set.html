<p>Sooner or later, having worked with RiC for a while, one will almost
certainly find oneself needing to make a judgement as to whether one has
a Record or a Record Set. Whilst the situation is rarely
black-and-white, our aim here is to provide some guidance upon this
question. We shall explore the matter quite thoroughly, as it gets to
the heart of several aspects of RiC.</p>
<p>All of the sections of this FAQ, given the subtleties involved and
the novelty of the way in which RiC embraces them, are likely most
appropriate for an intermediate or advanced user of RiC, or a beginner
working towards becoming such a user. The modelling diagrams included
along the way are quite rich; aspects of them may be of independent
interest.</p>
<p>We <a href="#import-data">begin</a> with an example of data upon
imports to the UK, discussing it from both a Record and a Record Set
perspective, as well as reflecting briefly upon the fact that a
judgement one way or another might be time-dependent: for instance, what
is deemed a Record Set at a certain point in time might later be judged
to be a Record in a particular context. We illustrate how Record Part
might be brought into this example; discuss how a Record can be regarded
as part of another Record and how this might be useful in this example;
suggest how multiple Instantiations of the table of import data might
arise; and conclude our exploration of this example with a few remarks
about the Record Resource entity.</p>
<p>We then <a href="#parish-registers">turn</a> to a complementary
example, of parish registers. Again, we discuss them from both a Record
and a Record Set perspective, elaborating more fully than in the import
data example on a Records-within-a-Record point of view. We conclude
with a discussion of how the distinction between a civil and a church
marriage in different countries might be handled in RiC.</p>
<p><a href="#minute-books">Next</a> we give a third example, of several
kinds of minute books, focusing upon where we might consider the
boundary between a Record and a Record Set to be. We first consider
minutes which arise from sittings of the House of the Commons in the UK,
before turning our attention to the minutes of the council of state in
Norway at the time of its invasion in 1940.</p>
<p>Finally, we <a href="#databases">return</a> to the import data
example, but with a different theme: generation of Records via
interaction with a database which is regarded as an Instantiation of a
Record Set. This section may be of particular interest for its treatment
of core elements of modern software — API calls and database
queries.</p>
<p>Don’t be put off by the subtleties of the exposition we will give!
One might think of RiC as providing a language to express the nuanced
judgement and experience which you as an archivist or records manager
already possess; there is no definitive right or wrong approach. The
semantics of RiC are ‘open-world’: judgements can always be changed,
elaborated upon, or clarified further.</p>
<p>Moreover, even though, as we shall explore, the distinction between
whether one has a Record Set or Record is regarded as meaningful and
significant in RiC, the attributes and relations available for each are
not all that different, so that in practice choosing one or the other is
unlikely to impose severe constraints — if you do find yourself needing
an attribute or relation which is only available for one of them, that
may be a good indication as to what you have.</p>

class="header-section-number">6b.2</span> Import dat<span class="end-of-section-heading">a<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<h3 data-number="6b.2.1" id="as-record"><span
class="header-section-number">6b.2.1</span> As Record</h3>
<p>Each half-year, HM Revenue &amp; Customs in the UK <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20251003101852/https://www.uktradeinfo.com/trade-data/latest-bulk-data-sets/#imports-(bds-imp-yymm)">publishes</a>
data on goods imported into the UK. The <a
href="miscellaneous/uk_import_data_july_2025.txt">data</a> can be
thought of as a table — though a text file in a custom <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20251026122409/https://www.uktradeinfo.com/media/ih3eqsz3/bds_technical_specification.xlsx">format</a>
is actually used — in which each row corresponds to a single import,
with the columns recording the commodity that was imported, the country
of despatch, the mode of transport, the port of arrival, the value of
the import, and so on.</p>
<p>This table might be viewed either as a Record or as a Record Set. As
RiC-CM puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most prominent difference in the description of Record Set and
Record is that the identity of the Record is directly derived from the
Record itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we view the table as documenting the activity as whole of
importing goods to the UK, then we might regard it as having this aspect
of self-sufficiency, i.e. as being a Record. The rows of the table,
i.e. individual imports, would then primarily be viewed via as a
contribution to an overall picture: as one import amongst many
despatched from a certain country, or with a particular mode of
transport, etc. This perspective might fit into a model as follows,
where we include the aspect that the half-year records assemble into a
sequence — see <a href="faq--sequences.html">§6e</a> for more on
sequences in RiC — and the distinction between the creation of the table
of import data and its publication.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/import_data_as_record.svg"><img
src="diagrams/import_data_as_record.svg"
alt="Import data as record" /></a></p>
<h3 data-number="6b.2.2" id="as-record-set"><span
class="header-section-number">6b.2.2</span> As Record Set</h3>
<p>Let us turn to how we might view the table of import data as a Record
Set. The key aspect of this is that we would regard each row primarily
as documenting an import, i.e. as a Record. The table itself would be
seen only as a collection/aggregation of such import documentation; by
contrast with when we view it as documenting import activity as a whole,
we could have restricted to a subset of the imports, or changed the
criteria for aggregation in some other way, without the nature and role
of the table being significantly different.</p>
<p>To elaborate a little, individual imports might originate with an
online submission to the <a
href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/customs-declaration-service">Customs
Declaration Service</a> — in the past, paper forms would have served
this purpose. We might model this as follows; the way in which the
Mechanism entity is used to express provenance in a software application
may be of particular interest.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/import_as_record.svg"><img
src="diagrams/import_as_record.svg" alt="Import as record" /></a></p>
<p>Once an import has been completed, suppose that the data sent in upon
declaration of it, along with data gathered subsequently, is entered as
a new row into the table of import data; this row becoming HR Revenue
&amp; Customs’ primary record of the import. A model of all of this in
the end might look as follows.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/import_data_as_record_set.svg"><img
src="diagrams/import_data_as_record_set.svg"
alt="Import data as record set" /></a></p>
<p>As an aside, it is not impossible that both the declaration record
and the import record have one and the same Instantiation (see <a
href="faq--the_instantiation_entity.html">§6c</a>) within HM Revenue
&amp; Customs’ software — as a row in a database table, or across
several tables related by foreign keys, say (see <a
href="#databases">below</a> for more on this). The distinction between
the two records at an intellectual level nevertheless allows us to
distinguish their different functions and creators, as well as to
express other differences in their provenance — that, for instance, a
user ID protected by various authentication mechanisms is required to
create an import declaration (giving a reasonable degree of assurance as
to the identity of its creator).</p>
<p>The difference between viewing the table of import data as a Record
Set or as a Record also manifests itself in the degree of significance
we attach to the syntactical form/tabular structure of the data. When
regarding the table as a Record, the fact that the rows have a common
syntax/the same columnar divisons is important; each row is one more
contribution to the scope of documentation defined by the overall table
structure. Whereas when we see the table as a Record Set, the fact that
the rows share a common syntax/structure is of secondary importance;
each row could have a different syntax, and indeed include different
data, without changing the perspective that what we have is a
collection/aggregation of import records.</p>
<h3 data-number="6b.2.3" id="time-dependence"><span
class="header-section-number">6b.2.3</span> Time-dependence</h3>
<p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs may not actually create a new table of
import data for each half-year period; they might have a single large
table with years worth of data, extracted from to create the published
half-yearly data. Internally at HM Revenue &amp; Customs, the large
table may primarily be viewed as documenting individual imports,
i.e. the Record Set perspective may be the default one; but the table of
half-yearly data extracted from it may principally be regarded as
enabling transparency and insight into import activity during that
half-year, i.e. the Record perspective may be dominant.</p>
<p>In particular, the judgement as to whether we have a Record Set or a
Record can change in time. This view of context as dynamic is an
important aspect of RiC.</p>
<p>The change from a Record Set to a Record perspective following
extraction of the half-yearly data might reflect archival/records
management realities: HM Revenue &amp; Customs might not regard the
table of half-yearly data as needing to archived and managed in the same
way as its large table of import data does, but a statistics bureau
which analyses the half-year period, or a governmental department which
takes the half-yearly data into account in its decision making, might
well do.</p>
<h3 data-number="6b.2.4" id="record-part"><span
class="header-section-number">6b.2.4</span> Record Part</h3>
<p>When we regard the table of import data as a Record, we might find it
useful to view each row as a Record Part, enabling us to formulate as
follows an analogue of the previous diagram (only part of which we
include below).</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/import_as_record_part.svg"><img
src="diagrams/import_as_record_part.svg"
alt="Import as record part" /></a></p>
<p>We might make use of Record Part at finer levels of granularity too,
corresponding to components of the rows of the table, say with the
intention of expressing the content of those components — countries,
modes of transport, and so on — in a structured way. This stretches
beyond the domain of RiC, but other standards could be brought to bear;
this would take us too far afield here, but it is touched upon in <a
href="extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote.html#broader-cultural-heritage-aspects">§8.8</a>,
and a brief discussion of complementary standards can be found in <a
href="combining_ric_with_other_standards.html">§4</a>. The following
diagram indicates how the the modelling might look as far as RiC
goes.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/import_data_record_parts.svg"><img
src="diagrams/import_data_record_parts.svg"
alt="Import data record parts" /></a></p>
<p>Geography frequently has something to say for the provenance of a
Record — there are several examples of this in <a
href="extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote.html">§8</a>,
for instance — or other archival/records management matters; designating
Costa Rica a Place, as we do in the diagram, opens the door for this.
Suppose for instance that HM Revenue &amp; Customs had an agreement to
pass on all data on imports from Costa Rica to the Costa Rican embassy
in London; we might bring this into our modelling, as follows for
instance. The use of <em>affects or affected</em> and <em>results or
resulted in</em> is a common pattern; we shall see it again in <a
href="faq--how_to_describe_activities_such_as_digitization_appraisal_or_disposition.html#digitization">§6d.2</a>,
for instance.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/use_of_place_with_record_part.svg"><img
src="diagrams/use_of_place_with_record_part.svg"
alt="Use of place with record part" /></a></p>
<p>A different example of the use of Record Part is discussed in <a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#my-archival-institution-holds-fragments-of-medieval-documents-how-might-ric-model-this">§6a.3.5</a>.</p>
<h3 data-number="6b.2.5" id="record-within-a-record"><span
class="header-section-number">6b.2.5</span> Record within a Record</h3>
<p>A Record in RiC can be considered to be part of another Record, and
thus it would be possible to adopt both of the perspectives we have
discussed at the same time: the table of import data as a whole could be
considered as a Record, documenting import activity as a whole in a
half-year period, whilst each row too could be considered a Record,
documenting a single import. This perspective might be appropriate, for
instance, if HM Revenue &amp; Customs does not simply extract the
half-yearly data and pass it on to a statistics bureau or governmental
department in the manner suggested <a href="#time-dependence">above</a>,
but makes use of the table of half-yearly data directly themselves in a
context in which import activity as a whole is relevant. We shall
discuss another example of this <a
href="#parish-registers">later</a>.</p>
<h3 data-number="6b.2.6" id="two-instantiations"><span
class="header-section-number">6b.2.6</span> Two instantiations</h3>
<p>As we mentioned at the <a href="#as-record">beginning</a> of our
exposition, the half-yearly import data is not actually published in a
tabular format as usually understood, but as a text file whose rows have
a certain custom format. We might well run a script to parse the text
file and create say a spreadsheet from it. In RiC we might regard a
single Record as being involved — import data for half a year — having
two Instantiations, text file and spreadsheet, the latter derived from
the former; the following diagram illustrates this.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/import_data_two_instantiations.svg"><img
src="diagrams/import_data_two_instantiations.svg"
alt="Two instantiations of import data" /></a></p>
<p>A few notes on the diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>We might often think of multiple Instantiations of a Record or
Record Set as being inscribed upon different media, but, as this example
illustrates, this need not be the case.</li>
<li>One could further elaborate upon the diagram to detail who carried
out the parsing of text file, using <em>is or was performed by</em>;
when it was carried out, using <em>occurred at date</em>; and so
on.</li>
<li>Expressing in a structured way — not only in free-text description —
that an Instantiation is a text file or a spreadsheet goes beyond the
domain of RiC. As discussed <a href="#record-part">above</a>, it would
be appropriate to introduce other standards into the diagram than RiC to
this end, for instance one or more of those touched upon in <a
href="combining_ric_with_other_standards.html">§4</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="6b.2.7"
id="where-does-record-resource-enter-the-picture"><span
class="header-section-number">6b.2.7</span> Where does Record Resource
enter the picture?</h3>
<p>The Record Resource entity serves primarily a placeholder for an
entity that might be a Record Set, Record, or Record Part. At a
meta-level, it is convenient when one wishes to allow a property to
allow any of these three entities in its domain or range, and it is
frequently used in this way in both RiC-CM and RiC-O. When employing RiC
in practice, the Record Resource entity can also be useful when one does
not wish to, or is unable to, make a judgement as to which of a Record
Set, Record, or Record Part one has. This might be for any number of
reasons, not least lack of time and/or resources — for instance when
working to migrate legacy metadata to RiC. This has practical
consequences, though: for instance, some relations and attributes are
only available for specific kinds of Record Resources, even if many are
shared.</p>
<h2 data-number="6b.3" id="parish-registers"><span
class="header-section-number">6b.3</span> Parish register<span class="end-of-section-heading">s<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<h3 data-number="6b.3.1" id="as-record-1"><span
class="header-section-number">6b.3.1</span> As Record</h3>
<p>Let us turn to a different example, of a parish register for
Bratsberg church in Norway, specifically to its <a
href="https://media.digitalarkivet.no/view/39552/44">documentation of
marriages in 1944</a>. We shall further explore the parish registers for
this church in <a
href="faq--how_to_describe_activities_such_as_digitization_appraisal_or_disposition.html#digitization">§6d.2</a>.</p>
<p>From an archival point of view, this register might primarily be
viewed as documentation of the church’s activity in the period of time
it covers: as a Record. The diagram below expresses this.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/parish_register_as_record.svg"><img
src="diagrams/parish_register_as_record.svg"
alt="Parish register as record" /></a></p>
<p>The entries for marriages are made into a pre-defined table. As
discussed <a href="#as-record-set">above</a> (the final paragraph) in
the case of regarding a table of import data, this fact that there is a
common format for the marriage registrations lends weight to the idea of
considering the parish register a Record.</p>
<h3 data-number="6b.3.2" id="as-record-set-1"><span
class="header-section-number">6b.3.2</span> As Record Set</h3>
<p>On the other hand, in 1944, the entry of a marriage into the parish
register was likely the primary documentation of it; for somebody
concerned with proof that a marriage took place, simply the existence of
an entry for that marriage in a parish register might be enough — the
format of the entry, or the full details, or what the parish register
includes beyond this single entry, might be of little consequence. Just
as <a href="#as-record-set">for imports</a>, we might in this context
consider a single marriage registration to be a Record, and the parish
register to be a Record Set; the following diagram illustrates such a
perspective.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/parish_register_as_record_set.svg"><img
src="diagrams/parish_register_as_record_set.svg"
alt="Parish register as record set" /></a></p>
<p>The difference in formulation of the Activity in the two diagrams in
this section is intended to highlight that in the first context, the
emphasis is upon documentation of Bratsberg church as an entity,
regardless of the precise nature of its activity; whereas it is
specifically the fact that marriages took place at Bratsberg church that
is relevant in the second context.</p>
<p>Even following the introduction of a national register for marriages,
an entry into which would today be regarded as the primary documentation
of a marriage from the point of view of the Norwegian state, a marriage
entry in a parish register could still be viewed as a Record of that
marriage — the fact that the marriage took place at a church might be of
significance for the bridal pair. In RiC, the judgement of whether one
has a Record Set, Record, or Record Part made in any context is a valid
as one made in an official administrative setting.</p>
<h3 data-number="6b.3.3" id="as-records-within-a-record"><span
class="header-section-number">6b.3.3</span> As Records within a
Record</h3>
<p>It is intriguing to ponder which point of view might have been
primary for the deacon or deacons of Bratsberg church, the records
managers of their day, at the time the parish register was created.
Perhaps both perspectives equally, in which case a judgement that we
have a case of Records within a Record — as discussed <a
href="#record-within-a-record">above</a> — might be natural. We
illustrate one way to express this in RiC in the following diagram; note
the slight readjustment of the formulation of the Activity once
again.</p>
<p><a
href="diagrams/parish_register_as_record_containing_records.svg"><img
src="diagrams/parish_register_as_record_containing_records.svg"
alt="Parish register as record containing records" /></a></p>
<h3 data-number="6b.3.4" id="further-considerations"><span
class="header-section-number">6b.3.4</span> Further considerations</h3>
<p>Today, in some countries, a marriage ceremony in a church will be
legally binding; an entry will be made into a national civil register of
marriages afterwards, in addition to into a parish register during the
ceremony. This is for instance the case in Norway for weddings performed
in a state church. One might in this case see the entries into the
national and parish registers as two Records deriving from the same
Event; we illustrate this below, including the fact that all marriages
in Norway after 1970 are required to be entered into the national
register.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/state_and_parish_registers_as_two_records.svg"><img
src="diagrams/state_and_parish_registers_as_two_records.svg"
alt="State and parish registers as two records" /></a></p>
<p>As an aside, the use of <em>has beginning date</em> above reflects
the fact that the law on entry into a national civil marriage register
came into force in 1970, but does not imply that the first Record of
either of either of the Record Sets in the diagram necessarily was
created in 1970. See the discussion of technical points in <a
href="extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote.html#records-of-the-council-of-castile-i">§8.5</a>
for more on this.</p>
<p>In other countries, France for instance, a religious marriage is an
entirely separate event from a civil marriage. We might then illustrate
the situation as follows instead.</p>

<p>Minute books are, from their inception, more self-consciously
archival in nature than parish registers. They can vary widely in
particulars: for a single sitting of the House of Commons in the UK, for
instance, two quite dissimilar kinds of minutes are taken. The first,
the Journal of the House of Commons, is a recording of the proceedings,
formal and concise; the second, Hansard, is a verbatim transcript of the
entire sitting (lightly polished and edited according to certain
conventions).</p>
<p>As an extreme example of the difference between the two, at the end
of the sitting of the 22nd of November 1965, a brief debate was held, <a
href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1965-11-22/debates/3121057b-e85f-4a19-9173-011d3ce1561c/SlumClearance%28Manchester%29">recorded</a>
in Volume 721 of Hansard, which is historically valuable for its
insights into what were termed the slum clearances in Manchester and
Liverpool. In the Journal of the House of Commons’ <a
href="http://assets.parliament.uk/Journals/HCJ_volume_221.pdf">record</a>
of the day, there is not a glimpse of this; only that there was a debate
upon the motion “That this House do now adjourn” (a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjournment_debate">standard
mechanism</a>) is recorded.</p>
<p>As an aside, there are subtleties here. Both the Journal of the House
of Commons and Hansard are published, so that the distinction between
the original manuscripts of each and their published copies — more the
domain of libraries — is relevant; whilst both are assembled from raw
notes which themselves are of archival importance. One might also
quibble over terminology, objecting say to referring to the content of
Hansard as minutes. Such matters are not very important for our present
discussion, and for simplicity we shall ignore them; we shall treat both
the Journal of the House of Commons and Hansard as if they themselves
are archival material.</p>
<p>Recall again the following, from RiC-CM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most prominent difference in the description of Record Set and
Record is that the identity of the Record is directly derived from the
Record itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The minutes (of either kind) of a single sitting of the House of
Commons would certainly have the requisite aspect of completeness or
wholeness to be considered a Record. But sometimes a sitting is
adjourned and an item taken up again the following day, so that the
minutes flow into another to some extent; the minutes also have a
certain degree of structure in their layout that to some extent binds
them together. Could then other periods of time than a single sitting
also be regarded as delimiting the boundaries of a Record?</p>
<p>Periods of time that the House of Commons itself orients itself
around to are candidates. An entire parliament (the period of time that
the UK’s legislative body is in situ between two elections) for
instance, or what are known as sessions of parliament (perhaps a year
long).</p>
<p>On the other hand, RiC-CM emphasises that the notions of Record and
Instantiation inform one another. Because the actual division into
volumes of the Journal of the House of Commons was and is constrained by
manuscript size — as well as by the feasibility of indexing for instance
— where one volume ends is in practice often somewhat arbitrary. In
particular, the volumes are not necessarily divided by session or
parliament; the same goes for Hansard.</p>
<p>Moreover, with regard to structure, if we compare to a <a
href="#as-record-1">parish register</a>, when entering a marriage into
the latter, it is fundamental to know which two people were married; the
existence of a column or pair of columns for this purpose is important —
before 1812, parish registers in Norway did not have such a structure,
and significantly more context is needed to find and read a marriage
entry. Compared to this, the structures reflected in the minutes might
be regarded as being of secondary significance, perhaps reflecting the
mechanisms of the activity of the House of Commons more than being
intrinsic to that activity itself.</p>
<p>Putting all this together, it would seem natural to restrict to
regarding a single sitting of the House of Cmmons as giving rise to a
Record, and rather regard the volumes of the Journal of the House of
Commons and Hansard as Record Sets, that is to say, characterise them
primarily as aggregations of minutes. We illustrate how this might be
modelled below.</p>

<h3 data-number="6b.4.2" id="invasion-of-norway-in-1940"><span
class="header-section-number">6b.4.2</span> Invasion of Norway in
1940</h3>
<p>The point of view that the Journal of the House of Commons and
Hansard are Records Sets whose delineations are shaped to a significant
extent by external factors is supported by a different example: a <a
href="https://media.digitalarkivet.no/view/153656/1">volume</a> of
minutes from the meetings of the council of state (statsråd) in Norway
in 1940. Such minutes are known as a protokoll, distinguished from more
informal minutes (a referat) by carrying legal weight and by various
matters of form, including the requirement that they be signed in order
to be considered authoritative. The council of state was and is
responsible for the enacting of law (kongelige resolusjoner — royal
decrees) upon authorisation by the king.</p>
<p>The minutes for each meeting are pasted in as they usually would be
from January until March, but the volume <a
href="https://media.digitalarkivet.no/view/153656/138">ends</a> suddenly
with only informal minutes from the 5th of April 1940. As an archivist’s
prologue to the latter states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The protokoll for the council of states which was held on the 5th of
April 1940 was not written up because of the German invasion of Norway
on the 9th of April of the same month.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Norwegian royal family and government fled north and then to
England. The council of state continued to be held both on the run and
then abroad, but the very different circumstances are reflected in the
aggregating of the minutes from these meetings into a new <a
href="https://media.digitalarkivet.no/view/39875/6">volume</a>.</p>
<p>The latter begins dramatically with a council of state held on the
9th of April in Hamar whose minutes consists of a single royal decree
announcing the temporary movement of the capital of Norway to Hamar.
This is followed the day after by a council of state held at Trysil,
whose minutes too consists of a single paragraph expressing a famous
refusal (known colloquially as “Kongens nei”) to capitulate to the
invading army.</p>
<p>We illustrate this situation of a compelled ‘splitting’ into two
Record Sets in the following diagram.</p>

<p>Some notes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This is a case where the structured inclusion of locations via the
Place entity is very useful, these being a key aspect of the archival
context — telling much of the story, indeed. They would be one of the
likely means of discovering this material.</li>
<li>The invasion of Norway is modelled as an Event rather than an
Activity because, within the archival context we have sketched, its
performance and purpose are not in scope: it is seen through a
historical lens, i.e. passively, simply as something that occurred which
had archival consequences. See <a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#can-you-elaborate-upon-the-difference-between-activity-and-event">§6a.3.3</a>
for further discussion of this.</li>
</ol>
<h2 data-number="6b.5" id="databases"><span
class="header-section-number">6b.5</span> Database<span class="end-of-section-heading">s<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>Finally, let us return to our import data <a
href="#import-data">example</a>. HM Revenue &amp; Customs’ software
might actually involve a database with a table of imports within it, the
latter having foreign keys pointing to other tables of importers,
currencies, modes of transport, and so on. This does not really affect
the analysis we carried out earlier; whether an Instantiation of what we
referred to earlier as a row of a table in fact in involves several
tables via foreign keys makes no significant conceptual difference to
the discussion.</p>
<p>That an Instantiation of the import data is a database might be
important in other ways, though. A database is dynamic: it can be
queried (and updated) programmatically, generating Records — the
instantiations of which might be quite different from tabular data.
Below we model how the Office of National Statistics in the UK might
query the import data in the course of generating its <a
href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/uktrade/july2025">statistics</a>
for July 2025.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/database.svg"><img src="diagrams/database.svg"
alt="Database" /></a></p>
<p>Here ‘UK import data’ Record Set belongs to what is sometimes known
as the ‘data layer’ of an application; the SQL query and API call belong
to the ‘business layer’ (several such calls might well be involved, but
we have included only one for simplicity); and the webpage of statistics
for July 2025 to the ‘presentation layer’.</p>
<p>A couple of notes on the diagram:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We draw particular attention to the distinction between the
creation of the statistics for July 2025, namely the Office of National
Statistics’ calling of an API, and the triggering and execution of
business logic within HM Revenue &amp; Customs’ software which results
from that API call. In particular, HM Revenue &amp; Customs’ software is
not regarded as creating the statistics Record.</p></li>
<li><p>The records pertaining to the SQL query and API call are here
taken to be the specific ones for the July 2025 data; they might be
instantiated as software logs, for instance. They are a form of
meta-metadata or ‘paradata’: rather than simply documenting that the
Office of National Statistics made use of HM Revenue &amp; Customs’
data, we are documenting how this was done. Further meta-metadata could
have been included: the precise timestamp of the API call and SQL query,
for instance, by means of the <em>has creation date</em> relation. See
<a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#do-you-have-examples-illustrating-chapter-6-of-ric-cm">§6a.3.4</a>
for more on interpolating with Activity and Record entities in this way
to express meta-metadata/paradata.</p>
<p>A different kind of meta-metadata would be documentation of the
business logic itself, rather than of executions of it: a template of an
API call and SQL query, say, without populating the template with
specific values (July 2025, etc).</p></li>
