<p>With the release of these Application Guidelines, we make
available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a crosswalk between the four earlier ICA standards <a
href="https://www.ica.org/resource/isadg-general-international-standard-archival-description-second-edition/">ISAD(G)</a>,
<a
href="https://www.ica.org/resource/isaar-cpf-international-standard-archival-authority-record-for-corporate-bodies-persons-and-families-2nd-edition/">ISAAR(CPF)</a>,
<a
href="https://www.ica.org/resource/isdf-international-standard-for-describing-functions/">ISDF</a>,
and <a
href="https://www.ica.org/resource/isdiah-international-standard-for-describing-institutions-with-archival-holdings/">ISDIAH</a>,
comprehensively mapping them to RiC-CM. It is in spreadsheet format: <a
href="mappings/crosswalk--ica_standards_to_ric-cm.xlsx">crosswalk–ica_standards_to_ric-cm.xlsx</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>a crosswalk between the EAD 2002 DTD and RiC-O 1.1. Again, it is
in spreadsheet format: <a
href="mappings/crosswalk--EAD2002_to_ric-o-1-1.xlsx">crosswalk–EAD2002_to_ric-o-1-1.xlsx</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a
href="#how-to-read-the-crosswalk-from-the-ica-standards-to-ric">first</a>
section of this part of the Application Guidelines explains the
structure of the spreadsheet, and suggests how to read it. The <a
href="#annotations-on-the-crosswalk-from-the-ica-standards-to-ric">second</a>
section provides annotations on this crosswalk, elaborating upon
particular points, including where there is more than one possible
mapping.</p>
<p>The relation of the four earlier ICA standards to RiC was discussed
in broad terms in <a
href="combining_ric_with_other_standards.html#the-ica-standards-ric-replaces">§4.2</a>.
A detailed example of how the crosswalk might be applied in practice is
given in <a href="getting_started_with_ric.html">§2</a>.</p>
<p>The <a
href="#annotations-on-the-crosswalk-from-EAD-2002-to-RiC-O-1-1">third</a>
section provides annotations on the crosswalk between EAD 2002 and RiC-O
1.1. We plan to release a mapping from EAC-CPF to RiC-O 1.1 as soon as
possible.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.2"
id="how-to-read-the-crosswalk-from-the-ica-standards-to-ric"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2</span> How to read the crosswalk from

<p>There are four tabs/sheets in the crosswalk spreadsheet, one each for
the mappings of ISAD(G), ISAAR(CPF), ISDF, and ISDIAH to RiC. Within
each tab, the mapping should be read from left to right. The elements of
the ICA standards are furthest to the left. These typically map in RiC
to either an attribute of a certain entities, or to a relation having
certain entities as its domain. In all cases, the entities come next
after the ICA standard elements, followed by an attribute if applicable
(left blank if not), and then by a relation if applicable (left blank if
not). Sometimes one maps not only to a relation, but to an attribute of
an entity in the range of the relation; in these cases, the relevant
entities are given in the columns following the relation, and their
attribute given in the columns following these again.</p>
<p>If an element from a former ICA standard maps to multiple possible
entities, attributes, or relations in RiC, the alternatives are listed.
Which to use will depend will upon your specific case in hand.</p>
<p>The mapping reflects the most evident and commonly applicable usages.
You should, though, feel free to map ICA elements to RiC in other ways,
where this makes sense in the setting in which you are example. The
ISAD(G) element 3.1.3 <em>Dates</em> for instance might certainly be
interpreted in different ways.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.3"
id="annotations-on-the-crosswalk-from-the-ica-standards-to-ric"><span
class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Annotations on the crosswalk
from the ICA standards to Ri<span class="end-of-section-heading">C<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<h3 data-number="5.3.1" id="isadg-3.1.4-level-of-description"><span
class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> ISAD(G) 3.1.4: Level of
Description</h3>
<p>ISAD(G) does not have equivalents for the RiC-CM entities Record
Resource, Record Part, and RiC-E06 Instantiation. These entities are not
therefore included in the mapping of ISAD(G) element 3.1.4 <em>Level of
Description</em> to RiC-CM.</p>
<p>The <em>file</em> level of description is typically mapped to Record
Set, as a file often contains multiple documents or consists of several
items. However, depending on the archival traditions and descriptive
practices of your country or cultural context, <em>file</em> level may
also have been used in such a way that mapping to Record is more
appropriate — particularly in situations where <em>file</em> is the
smallest archival unit commonly used.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.3.2" id="isadg-3.2.3-archival-history"><span
class="header-section-number">5.3.2</span> ISAD(G) 3.2.3: Archival
history</h3>
<p>Archival history may be described using free narrative text, and
hence the History attribute in RiC is used in the crosswalk. However,
whenever possible, activities such as appraisal, destruction, and
scheduling should be represented in a more structured way in RiC,
e.g. using the Activity entity in the manner discussed in <a
href="faq--how_to_describe_activities_such_as_digitization_appraisal_or_disposition.html">§6d</a>.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.3.3" id="isadg-3.6.1-note"><span
class="header-section-number">5.3.3</span> ISAD(G) 3.6.1: Note</h3>
<p>RiC-CM does not have a direct equivalent to the ISAD(G) element
<em>Note</em>, being primarily designed to accommodate all information
relevant to archival description through the entities, attributes, and
relations which it defines. Nevertheless, the attribute General
Description serves as a generic text field, and might be used to record
one or more characteristics that are not otherwise captured by more
specific RiC attributes or relations.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.3.4"
id="isdf-isaarcpf-5.4-and-isdiah-5.6-control-area"><span
class="header-section-number">5.3.4</span> ISDF &amp; ISAAR(CPF) 5.4 and
ISDIAH 5.6: Control Area</h3>
<p>The <em>control area</em> in these three standards is intended for
information about an archival description itself — that is to say,
meta-metadata. How to handle this in RiC is the topic of §6.4 in RiC-CM,
and is elaborated upon in <a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#do-you-have-examples-illustrating-chapter-6-of-ric-cm">§6a.3.4</a>.
In short, one might map to a Record holding the meta-metadata, often via
the Activity of describing the Record Resource in question. The
attributes and relations of the mapped-to enable description of an
archival description as a Record Resource in its own right.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.4"
id="annotations-on-the-crosswalk-from-ead-2002-and-ric-o-1.1."><span
class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Annotations on the crosswalk
from EAD 2002 and RiC-O 1.1<span class="end-of-section-heading">.<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>The crosswalk is not at all a complete specification, that would be
ready to use; it is just a generic mapping between the EAD 2002 DTD and
<a href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology">RiC-O 1.1</a>, the
former currently remaining the most widely-used of the EAD versions. The
Tag Library of EAD 2002 DTD can be accessed <a
href="https://www.loc.gov/ead/tglib//">here</a>; a few EAD
elements are still missing from the crosswalk.</p>
<p>The content of the spreadsheet can be discussed or even contradicted,
but we hope that it might be useful, at least as far as initiating
reflection. It should be modified or refined according to the rules by
which EAD is applied within your institution, in your specific project,
or in national or supranational recommendations, should you be called
upon to prepare these.</p>
<p>EAD 2002 is very flexible, and includes many mixed content elements.
Indeed, when EAD is implemented in a given context, most usually a
specific, more constraining profile is used. Therefore, a local mapping
will probably far exceed what is proposed below.</p>
<p>A more precise specification for converting EAD documents to a RiC-O
1.1 dataset is provided by the <a
href="https://archivesnationalesfr.github.io/rico-converter/en/Mappings.html">documentation</a>
and <a
href="https://archivesnationalesfr.github.io/rico-converter/en/UnitTests.html">unit
tests</a> of the open source software <a
href="https://github.com/ArchivesNationalesFR/rico-converter">RiC-O
Converter</a>, developed for and with the Archives nationales de France.
Its version 3.0.0 enables the production of a consistent RiC-O 1.1
dataset from a collection of more than 30,000 archival finding aids
written in EAD 2002, conforming to a more restrictive DTD. We have drawn
inspiration from this experience in developing the crosswalk.</p>
<p>The mapping is intended for a human reader. To take full advantage of
the provided mapping, you should be familiar with EAD 2002 and RiC-O,
understand an XPath expression, and be able to read RDF expressed in
Turtle syntax. In the spreadsheet we have used EAD c elements; the same
mapping can be provided for numbered c elements (c01, c02, etc.).</p>
<p>Before embarking on a project to convert finding aids to XML/EAD
2002, you should also define a strategy (see <a
href="implementation_strategies.html#map-your-legacy-data-to-ric">§3.6</a>
for more) for assigning IRIs to the instances of the RiC-O classes — at
least rico:RecordResource and its subclasses, as well as rico:Agent and
its sub-classes — you will make use of, and for maintaining these IRIs.
If the archdesc and c (or numbered c) elements of your finding aids all
have an id attribute, and the values of this attribute are unique and
persistent in your information system, this can constitute a good
starting point. Having authority records on the agents and/or places
mentioned in the finding aids, and controlled vocabularies (see <a
href="faq--how_to_use_ric_with_vocabularies.html">§6f</a>) whose entries
are also mentioned in your finding aids, constitutes a favorable
situation.</p>
<p>It may also be important to establish whether the same archival
materials are described more than once in your collection of finding
aids. If that is the case, you might try to reconcile these descriptions
into a single one for the archival resource described, or link them
ogether.</p>
<p>Finally, the mapping does not take into account formatting elements
present in EAD, such as titlepage, runner, or table. Nor does it mention
the audience attribute. If your goal is to publish the RDF dataset you
produce as open-access, it’s worth checking whether you’re using the
audience attribute, and in particular making sure you do not take into
account, when processing the EAD files, c, numbered c, or scopecontent
elements that have an audience attribute with the value ‘internal’.</p>
<p>Remember that it is possible to store an XML structure as the value
of a RDF datatype property: see <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Syntax-XML-literals">https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Syntax-XML-literals</a>),
which may be very helpful if you wish to convert the text content of EAD
elements like bioghist, custodhist or scopecontent, that might include a
series of p or list elements. Converting them to a XHTML structure
included in a html:div wrapper element, as the RiC-O converter does, is
often helpful.</p>
<p>Of course, if you can pre-process the content of your finding aids to
improve their quality, and/or produce structures from your text
elements, recognizing named entities using AI for example, the result
will be much better. But this is not always possible. Even in cases
where it is not, it is possible to produce RiC-O compliant RDF from EAD
files.</p>
