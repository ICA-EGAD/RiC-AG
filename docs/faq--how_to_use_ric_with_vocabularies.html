<p>In this FAQ, we <a
href="#vocabularies-as-solutions-to-assigning-values-to-several-ric-cm-attributes">begin</a>
by giving a brief introduction to how vocabularies can be used in
combination with RiC-CM-compliant entity descriptions; RiC-CM includes a
significant number of attributes that serve as connection points between
the two.</p>
<p>We <a
href="#using-skos-vocabularies-to-populate-classes-in-ric-o-datasets">then</a>
provide a brief overview of how RDF vocabularies can be used in a RiC-O
dataset. Properties (relations) and classes allowing for this are
available in RiC-O in greater numbers than in RiC-CM, with possibilities
for extension.</p>
<p>We highlight some points of note in both situations.</p>

have the value schema ‘controlled value’. The table below provides an

<p>Most of these attributes are used, as their name indicates, to assign
a type to the entities described, i.e. categorize them. The other
attributes are of a different nature, but all have one thing in common:
as section 3.5 of RiC-CM specifies, their value should not be freely
chosen, but</p>
<blockquote>
<p>should be selected from controlled lists of authorized (or
authoritative) terms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is to say, from a controlled vocabulary as defined by the ISO
25964 standard, specifically <a
href="https://www.iso.org/standard/53657.html">ISO 25964-1:2011</a>,
item 2.12, pg.3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prescribed list of terms, headings or codes, each representing a
concept.</p>
<p>Controlled vocabularies are designed for applications in which it is
useful to identify each concept with one consistent label, for example
when classifying documents, indexing them and/or searching them.
Thesauri, subject heading schemes and name authority lists are examples
of controlled vocabularies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concretely, even if none of our suggestions here are to be regarded
as obligatory, it is preferable, when you wish to use attributes to
describe an entity, to proceed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identify controlled vocabularies that can be used to assign
values to these attributes in your institution, work community, country,
or elsewhere. If your institution does not have a vocabulary available,
aim for public, well-known, widely-used, and good quality
vocabularies.</p>
<p>If you cannot find an appropriate vocabulary from which to assign
values to certain attributes, try to create one. This kind of work is
never done in isolation, and takes time, but even if it isn’t complete
or perfect, if your information system is able to offer you the list of
declared values and force you to use only these values, your metadata
will always gain in consistency and quality.</p></li>
<li><p>In the appropriate way depending upon the technical architecture
of your software and its functionalities, ensure that you record, in the
description of an entity, either the name, the identifier, or both of
the term in your vocabulary or list which seems most relevant to
you.</p>
<p>Ideally, both a name and an identifier should be recorded. Typically
the most important would be the identifier, usually defined to be unique
and persistent, as it allows retrieval and access even if the concept
changes name or position in your vocabulary. Such identifiers are not
mentioned in RiC-CM as they are not of primary importance conceptually,
but when you implement RiC-CM and need to define a logical and then
physical model for your metadata, they will almost be
essential.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here we are only stating good practices which are already
well-established within many institutions, and which are often followed
when indexing the description of archival resources within finding aids
conforming to ISAD(G); possibly accompanied by descriptions of persons,
corporate bodies and families conforming to ISAAR(CPF).</p>
<p>An example is provided by the Society of American Archivists’ Encoded
Archival Standards: Best Practices Guide. The <a
href="https://saa-sdt.github.io/EAS-Best-Practices/docs/examples/eaccpf-examples.html">EAC-CPF
examples page of this guide</a> provides a link to <a
href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-Best-Practices/refs/heads/main/_examples/eaccpf-matturbancenter.xml">an
XML file</a> that describes a corporate body, the Lt. Col. Matt Urban
Human Services Center of Western New York, in which the following
XML/EAC-CPF code block is to be found:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;function valueURI=&quot;http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300055433&quot; vocabularySource=&quot;aat&quot;

        &lt;/geographicCoordinates&gt;
    &lt;/place&gt;
&lt;/places&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The activity of this corporate body is briefly described, and linked
to the activity of <a
href="http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300055433">community
development</a> in the <a
href="https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/">Getty
Center’s Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT)</a>, the URI of the
activity being provided in the valueURI attribute of the
<code>function</code> element, and that of the thesaurus itself being
given by the vocabularySourceURI attribute of <code>function</code>. In
addition to the HTML view, the AAT thesaurus is available formally in
RDF and other formats. As well as the URI, the preferred term ‘community
development’ is encoded in the <code>term</code> subelement of
<code>function</code>. We will return to this example later.</p>
<p>Regardless of the technical architecture and storage formats you work
with constructing descriptions, such good practices should ideally be
applied to all RiC-CM entities you include, no matter whether Record
Resources or contextual entities. This will provide your end users with
precise and functional search criteria. If your vocabularies are
generic, possibly multilingual, ones in widespread use, federated search
across institutions will be possible.</p>
<h3 data-number="6f.2.1" id="some-additional-observations"><span
class="header-section-number">6f.2.1</span> Some additional
observations</h3>
<p>RiC-CM is more precise than traditional description standards when it
comes to categorizing record resources. In particular, three attributes,
Record Set Type, Documentary Form Type, and State, are proposed to
categorize these resources, whilst a single vocabulary might well define
concepts falling under all three of these categories.</p>
<p>Even though, as discussed in <a
href="faq--record_or_record_set.html">§6b</a>, it is not always easy to
decide whether what is being described is a Record Set or a Record,
since the conceptual model distinguishes between these two entities, it
is logical to distinguish between types of Record Set and types of
Record, and therefore between the attributes that allow these types to
be specified; thus between Record Set Type and the other two. State
refers to the state of production or dissemination of a Record or Record
Part, such as ‘original’ or ‘authentic copy’, which is quite different
from its form — such as ‘register’ or ‘papal bull’ — or the type of
legal action it sanctions, such as ‘sale’, ‘document of legal
proceedings’, or ‘plan’. These last two are not always easy to
distinguish between, and today in RiC-CM they both fall under
Documentary Type.</p>
<p>Conversely, the very generic Demographic Group attribute must
normally be extended in order to be useful; see <a
href="faq--how_to_extend_ric.html">§6g</a> for more on this subject. The
Occupation Type attribute, being defined as a sub-attribute of
Demographic Group, is an extension already integrated into RiC.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use authority lists or classification schemes
to fill in attributes other than those listed in the table above. A
typical case would for the Name attribute when it is associated with an
Agent or Place entity.</p>
<p>Be sure to comply with the specification of the attributes in RiC-CM.
In particular, you should only use a given attribute to categorize an
entity that is indicated as being in the domain of that attribute; an
attribute is by definition a characteristic inherent to an entity.</p>
<p>The attributes Content Type, Documentary Form Type, Language, Legal
Status, and State have the special aspect, explained in section 3.4 of
RiC-CM, that although a priori attributes of a Record or Record Part,
RiC-CM allows them to be used as attributes of any Record Resource; when
used to describe a Record Set, this is to be understood to mean that the
Record Set includes Records having the specified attribute. Such a
possibility can greatly facilitate the migration of ISAD(G)-style
archival descriptions to RiC-CM, where sets of records are quite often
indexed with several genre or form terms.</p>
<p>If an attribute is specified as non-repeatable, this means that in
principle you cannot assign more than one value to this attribute for
the same entity. As an example, the repeatable Language attribute can be
used to express that a given Record has content in several different
languages, but since Documentary Form Type and State are non-repeatable,
it is to be assigned a single legal status or state. If there seem to be
several possibilities, the narrowest, most precise term should be chosen
— in a well-designed, comprehensive vocabulary, there should exist such
a choice.</p>
<h2 data-number="6f.3"
id="using-skos-vocabularies-to-populate-classes-in-ric-o-datasets"><span
class="header-section-number">6f.3</span> Using SKOS vocabularies to
populate classes in RiC-O dataset<span class="end-of-section-heading">s<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>Moving from RiC-CM to RiC-O, each of the attributes in the table
apart from Classification for now, but along with Name, is formalised as
a class; see the <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/RiC-O_1-1.html#fromRiCCM-to-RiCO">RiC-O
documentation</a> for more on this. This enables us to assign a URI,
labels and other relevant properties to each of the values used.</p>
<p>There are few slight differences in nomenclature: Production
Technique corresponds to <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#ProductionTechniqueType">rico:ProductionTechniqueType</a>,
whilst State corresponds to <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#RecordState">rico:RecordState</a>.
Reflecting the fact discussed above that Occupation Type is a
specialization of Demographic Group, the <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#OccupationType">rico:OccupationType</a>
class is defined as a subclass of <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#DemographicGroup">rico:DemographicGroup</a>.
All of these classes coming from RiC-CM attributes, and others, have
been grouped under a <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Concept">rico:Concept</a>
class.</p>
<p>Let’s revisit the XML/EAC-CPF code block presented above. To
represent this data in accordance with RiC-CM, we would need to
distinguish multiple entities more clearly, and link them together, as
follows for instance.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/activityType_ric-cm.svg"><img
src="diagrams/activityType_ric-cm.svg"
alt="Categorizing an Activity using RiC-CM" /></a></p>
<p>In this diagram, the activity described by the <code>function</code>
element of the code block becomes an entity of its own, linked to the
Corporate Body in question by the <em>performs or performed</em>
relation in the manner discussed elsewhere in the Application
Guidelines, such as in <a href="faq--sequences.html">§6e</a>. This
Activity has been equipped with an Activity Type attribute, and is also
described by a General Description attribute. Finally, it is linked to a
Place entity, which has a name (used as a label for the entity in the
diagram) and geographical coordinates, the latter recorded using the
Coordinates attribute.</p>
<p>If we used RiC-O, we would instead end up with a graph like the
following one. We might have modeled the Place entity differently,
producing a more detailed description - but that is not the subject that
concerns us here.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/activityType_ric-o.svg"><img
src="diagrams/activityType_ric-o.svg"
alt="Categorizing an Activity using RiC-O" /></a></p>
<p>In this RDF graph, the Activity Type attribute has become an instance
of the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept">skos:Concept</a>
class: ‘Community development’ is indeed a concept that categorizes the
activity described; and to define this concept, we have chosen to use a
data model that the W3C has developed and which is widely used to
formalize concepts and vocabularies: <a
href="https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">Simple Knowledge Organization
System (SKOS)</a>. As with (almost) everything in RDF, the ‘Community
development’ Activity Type implicitly has an URI, and we have equipped
it with a label, but SKOS also facilitates assigning other properties to
it, though we omit this in the diagram: a definition, scope notes,
examples, change notes, relations to broader or narrower concepts, and
so on. It is a concept that we could define in a <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#ConceptScheme">skos:ConceptScheme</a>
developed by our institution or project, and is declared as equivalent
to the concept with the same name in the Getty Center’s AAT thesaurus
(which is itself expressed in RDF, in accordance with SKOS and an
ontology developed by the Getty Center), using the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#exactMatch">skos:exactMatch</a>
relation.</p>
<p>We could alternatively choose not to create and manage the
description of this concept ourselves, and instead link the Activity
directly to the AAT concept as follows (using Turtle syntax, and
supposing that the activity described has</p>
<pre><code>https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/examples#AG_section_06_faq_vocabs_Activity</code></pre>
<p>as URI):</p>
<pre><code>@prefix rico: &lt;https://www.ica/org/standards/RiC/ontology#&gt; .
@prefix ric-ex: &lt;https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/examples#&gt; .

&lt;ric-ex:AG_section_06_faq_vocabs_Activity&gt; rico:hasActivityType
    &lt;http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300055433&gt; .</code></pre>
<p>Choosing between these two options depends upon our modelling
strategy, which may depend upon available human and technical resources;
the lists or vocabularies we already have and our plans concerning them;
the existence or not of external vocabularies that are truly suited to
our needs; and so on. Whatever our decision, the vocabulary we wish to
use with RiC-O data should be expressed in RDF; and the <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#hasActivityType">rico:hasActivityType</a>
object property should be used to link the ‘Community development’
Activity to the concept that categorizes it. An analogous object
property, and an inverse for it, exists for all of the attributes which
we are discussing here.</p>
<p>If we were to apply a reasoner to the above RDF snippet, it would
infer, and add to the existing graph, that the concept with URI
<code>http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300055433</code> is an instance of
the <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#ActivityType">rico:ActivityType</a>
class, because the <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#hasActivityType">rico:hasActivityType</a>
property is formally defined in RiC-O as having as range <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#ActivityType">rico:ActivityType</a>.
See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#RDFSRules%5D">RDFS entailment
rules</a> for more on this.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is permitted to explicitly specify that the
concepts you use to categorize Activities are both an instance of
skos:Concept and of the <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#ActivityType">rico:ActivityType</a>
RiC-O class; the same is true in all analogous cases, and is the
approach taken by, for instance, the Archives nationales de France. This
makes it possible to immediately have vocabularies and concepts whose
formal specification is complete, and which are therefore ready to be
used in RiC-O datasets, without having to rely on a reasoner. Later, it
may also enable, depending upon time and means, moving beyond
terminology, using RiC-O properties to assign say temporal or spatial
dimensions to the concepts described; to connect them to Rules when
appropriate (decrees, legal texts, policies…); to express that they have
successor concepts, and so on; in other words to contextualize concepts.
Particularly interesting might be the contextualization of Activity
Types, Documentary Form Types, or Corporate Body Types.</p>
<p>If you do not have, or cannot find, any appropriate vocabulary for
populating RiC-O classes, the <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#type">rico:type</a>
datatype property to store, as a string, the term you wish to use. If
you need to define another category than those in RiC-O today, you can
easily extend RiC-O, creating in your own ontology a subclass of <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Concept">rico:Concept</a>
or <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Type">rico:Type</a>,
and defining the properties you needed to connect the relevant entities
to your new concept. See <a href="faq--how_to_extend_ric.html">§6g</a>
for more on this.</p>
<p>Finally, note that RiC-O defines various ‘Type’ classes: <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#ExtentType">rico:ExtentType</a>,
<a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#IdentifierType">rico:IdentifierType</a>,
<a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#RoleType">rico:RoleType</a>
and <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#TitleType">rico:TitleType</a>.
The same considerations as we have brought up apply to these.</p>
<h3 data-number="6f.3.1" id="some-additional-observations-1"><span
class="header-section-number">6f.3.1</span> Some additional
observations</h3>
<p>As explained <a href="#some-additional-observations">above</a>,
RiC-CM allows the use of Content Type, Documentary Form Type, Language,
Legal Status, and State attributes to categorize a Record Set, even
though actually means that all or part of the members of the Record Set
have this attribute. RiC-O, as is often the case (see <a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#what-is-the-relationship-between-ric-o-and-ric-cm">§6f.2.2</a>,
is more precise than RiC-CM in this regard, and defines a larger number
of relations (object properties), each having a very specific meaning.
For example, the domain of the <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#hasDocumentaryFormType">rico:hasDocumentaryFormType</a>
property is reduced to the union of <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#Record">rico:Record</a>
and <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#RecordPart">rico:RecordPart</a>,
so that you cannot use this property with a Record Set. If you want to
link a Record Set to a <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#DocumentaryFormType">rico:DocumentaryFormType</a>,
you will need to use either the <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#hasOrHadSomeMembersWithDocumentaryFormType">rico:hasOrHadSomeMembersWithDocumentaryFormType</a>
property or the <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#hasOrHadAllMembersWithDocumentaryFormType">rico:hasOrHadAllembersWithDocumentaryFormType</a>
property.</p>
<p>To transform legacy metadata into RiC-O data, to choose the right
property, you may in some cases need to comprehensively analyze your
data. The presence of several index terms designating document types for
the same Record Set will for instance allow you to deduce that the
correct property is <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#hasOrHadSomeMembersWithDocumentaryFormType">rico:hasOrHadSomeMembersWithDocumentaryFormType</a>.
In the absence of index terms, an analysis of the title of the Record
Set, for instance mentions in plural of different document types, might
lead you to the same conclusion. If the Record Set described is a series
designated by a single plural document type, such as ‘Photographs’, you
can probably deduce that you can use <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#hasOrHadAllMembersWithDocumentaryFormType">rico:hasOrHadAllembersWithDocumentaryFormType</a>.</p>
<p>Note that if you have asserted that all the members of a Record Set
have documentary form type ‘photograph’ for example, you might consider
inferring that each Record included in the Record Set has documentary
form type (<a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#hasDocumentaryFormType">rico:hasDocumentaryFormType</a>)
‘photograph’. Future versions of RiC-O may allow for a greater degree of
automation in this regard.</p>
<h3 data-number="6f.3.2" id="a-more-complex-use-case"><span
class="header-section-number">6f.3.2</span> A more complex use case</h3>
<p>RiC-O provides a technical method for dating and, more generally
speaking, contextualizing the relation between an entity and the
category it may belong to. This is touched upon at the end of <a
href="extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote.html#records-of-the-council-of-castile-i">§8.5</a>,
but let us give another example.</p>
<p>The Archives nationales de France, which was created in 1790, only
received its current status as a ‘service à compétence nationale’
(service with national competence; a status authorizing them to carry
out missions halfway between those of central administration and
territorial administration) in December 2006f. To model this in RiC-O, we
might use the <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#TypeRelation">rico:TypeRelation</a>
in the following way.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/corporateBodyType_withDate_ric-o.svg"><img

<h2 data-number="6f.4" id="conclusion"><span
class="header-section-number">6f.4</span> Conclusio<span class="end-of-section-heading">n<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>Many institutions, consortia, and national projects have developed
vocabularies that now make it possible to index, in traditional archival
descriptions, the subjects or themes of archival resources and, more
broadly, cultural objects. There also are more specialized vocabularies
such as those used to indicate what is represented by a visual document.
As touched upon in <a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#is-describing-the-content-of-a-record-within-rics-domain">§6a.3.1</a>,
the concepts defined in these vocabularies can be used to specify the
subjects of the records described, using the <em>has or had subject</em>
or <em>has or had main subject</em> relations and their corresponding
properties in RiC-O, which also include more specific properties such as
<a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#hasContentWhichRepresents">rico:hasContentWhichRepresents</a>.
More generally, since anything can be the subject of a Record Resource,
these relations can target any type of RiC-CM entity. For example, the
file of a civil servant, included in a series created by a ministry’s
Human Resources department, has the civil servant as its main
subject.</p>
<p>We have also emphasized in this FAQ that, even if you do not use
RiC-O to describe records, only RiC-CM, you can still make use of the
many vocabularies or lists published on the web as RDF datasets, after
having verified their quality and relevance for your needs, and having
ensured that their governance guarantees their long-term maintenance.
The notions defined in these RDF vocabularies always have a unique
identifier, and they should, as RDF data, remain accessible online.
SKOS, as the main technical standard used to structure these
vocabularies, and being defined by the W3C, is widely used today and not
likely to lose its popularity or become obsolete.</p>
<p>As a final remark, to help improve the quality of archival and
records management metadata, increasing the chances of linking RiC
metadata sets together, and facilitating federated or large-scale user
searches, it is important that the community equips itself with
vocabularies capable of covering its own needs, maintained by itself.
These may be fairly generic and include terms in several languages. To
this end, the EGAD group has so far defined two vocabularies and, within
them, created seven concepts in total; see <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/RiC-O_1-1.html#individuals">the
section on individuals</a> in the HTML view of RiC-O. If you wish to
download these vocabularies as separate files, <a
href="https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/tree/master/ontology/current-version/modularized-version">the
modularized version of RiC-O</a> may be convenient.</p>
<p>In its program of work, EGAD plans to construct more vocabularies. In
addition to the two already started, which will need to be enriched, it
plans to work on vocabularies for Rule Types and Activity Types, to
initially cover at least terms of importance in records management and
the curation of records.</p>
