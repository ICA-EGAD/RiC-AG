<p>Now that you understand its benefits (<a
href="what_are_the_benefits_of_using_ric.html">§1</a>), a question
remains: how would you approach the implementation of RiC in your
organization? This needs thinking about, and may take serious effort.
You will need to develop an understanding of the needs and goals of your
organization in relation to the changes in archival description practice
that RiC reflects.</p>
<p>We cannot provide a step-by-step guide to implemententing RiC — the
huge variety of specific use-cases make this impossible. Instead, our
aim in this part of the Application Guidelines is to provide a list of
actions that might be considered. It should not be regarded as complete
or definitive. In describing some possible scenarios, we hope to give
you an idea of steps that might prove useful in your own situation.</p>
<p>The following broad topics will be covered:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Why does one need RiC?</p></li>
<li><p>How to start with RiC?</p></li>
<li><p>What to do with legacy data?</p></li>
<li><p>How to describe records using RiC?</p></li>
<li><p>What needs to be changed to implement RiC?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will make recommendations intended to help you define a proof of
concept for the implementation of RiC and/or to define a business case,
balancing the benefits which RiC brings with the necessary investment of
resources.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.2" id="overview"><span
class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Overvie<span class="end-of-section-heading">w<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>Implementing RiC is a change, and needs clear goals. <a
href="#identify-needs-and-set-goals">Identifying</a> the expected
outcomes is a good place to start. You will need to <a
href="#learn-ric">become familiar with RiC</a> to ensure it will meet
your needs. RiC is <a href="#a-new-way-of-thinking">new</a> and, taken
as a whole, quite complex, so <a
href="#start-small-and-evolve-over-time">start with small steps</a>. A
pilot project is a good place to start, especially if there is legacy
data. The latter must be reviewed and <a
href="#map-your-legacy-data-to-ric">transformed into RiC</a>, and
existing cataloguing processes <a
href="#introduce-ric-in-your-software">will need to be adapted</a>. If
there are software tools, they may need to be adjusted or replaced. We
elaborate on all of this below.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.3" id="identify-needs-and-set-goals"><span
class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Identify needs and set
goal<span class="end-of-section-heading">s<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>Ask yourself: what is the most useful thing that RiC will give you?
Archival description is a practical activity, carried out to achieve
various aims such as summarizing the content of a body of records;
revealing their contexts for a better understanding; improving their
management; and improving access to them. These aims can change over
time, so any organization should regularly review their processes to
align them with emerging needs. A change in this regard might be a
suitable moment for implementing RiC.</p>
<p>If you are an organization with very few records, whose focus is more
upon administrative aspects of custodianship, less upon facilitating an
improved experience for users, then a full, extensive implementation of
RiC might not be the best solution for you, though it may still prove
useful. In contrast, if you for instance carry out large-scale
digitisation of paper records; if you have many entities to describe
(records and/or agents and/or functions and more) and you need to reveal
their complex links; or if you have large holdings and you are keen to
link your data with the wider cultural heritage environment, then RiC
could prove to be a valuable tool to use. These examples are not
exhaustive; the point is that adopting RiC should be connected to needs
and goals.</p>
<p>A pilot project might involve an assessment of your current practices
and contexts, and identification of issues. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>your current archival descriptions might be siloed, making it
difficult to express complex relationships between records, agents,
functions or events;</p></li>
<li><p>your descriptions might be duplicated due to the creation of
copies of records on microfilm, in a digital format, or because there
are several descriptions of the same records in different finding
aids;</p></li>
<li><p>it might be difficult to describe how records came to be created
and used accurately because of parallel provenances;</p></li>
<li><p>your archival contexts are presented in a few limited ways
(either hierarchical or in flat lists, for instance), limiting
discoverability and usability.</p></li>
<li><p>in your administrative or societal landscape, there might be
pressure towards sharing your data with various institutions, or
integrating it into various networks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, you might conclude that more flexible and connected
descriptions are needed.</p>
<p>The pin-pointing of such issues might come from internal staff —
archivists, ICT specialists, and others — or from users. The tools and
methodologies used to gather this information might include focus
groups, surveys, and interviews. Carrying out these activities can be
time-consuming, and the results will need to be reviewed and compiled to
reach a well-defined set of requirements.</p>
<p>This stakeholder analysis report might also go a step further, to
describe the expected benefits of adopting RiC as a solution, guiding an
implementation process. For indeed, by implementing RiC, some of the
above issues may find a solution:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>RiC will enhance discovery of archival resources by linking
records to their creators, functions, and events;</p></li>
<li><p>it will ease the transition from hierarchical (multi-level) to
networked (multi-dimensional) archival descriptions, providing more ways
to reveal the rich network of contexts for records;</p></li>
<li><p>it will enable interoperability with other cultural heritage
institutions;</p></li>
<li><p>it will provide metadata for AI/ML applications (e.g. entity
extraction, knowledge graphs).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If your organization concludes that RiC will meet its needs, then you
will likely need to begin to explore how to implement it in detail,
including building up a business case. We turn now to how you might
proceed.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.4" id="start-small-and-evolve-over-time"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Start small and evolve over
tim<span class="end-of-section-heading">e<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>RiC implementation is likely to work best as an evolutionary process.
It might start with describing a specific type of data such as Agents,
or upgrading infrastructure to support RiC, such as moving to holding
data in triple stores. Or you might begin by focusing upon improving
publication of data on/from your records, via APIs for instance, and
only afterwards focus upon your descriptions themselves. Again, it is up
to each organization to decide its goals and how much of RiC should be
used.</p>
<p>A pilot project, either at the earlier stage discussed <a
href="#identify-needs-and-set-goals">above</a> or when starting to
actually implement RiC, might involve working initially with a small set
of data, then, based on the lessons learnt, planning the next phase of
work.</p>
<p>At the same time, it should be kept in mind that, in a preliminary
phase, not all details about how your implementation of RiC will look
may be clear. You may not yet know the specifics of activities that will
need to be carried out, or exactly the resources that will be needed —
whether with regard to finance, time, expertise, or software. Your focus
should then likely be upon business objectives, upon impact, and upon
high-level strategy: the need to retrofit the existing data, or to adapt
or purchase software, infrastructure, processes, and expertise.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.5" id="learn-ric"><span
class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Learn Ri<span class="end-of-section-heading">C<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>Becoming familiar with RiC in-depth is an important early step for
your whole team, so that the viewpoints and needs of people in all kinds
of roles are considered. Indeed, although it is key that those who will
be most heavily involved in the implementation, and those who have a
strategic or leadership role within your organization, are familiar with
RiC, a RiC implementation is more than a simple new process for
describing your records; it will have an impact on the work of many
people, internal and amongst your users. Archivists and records managers
might look at RiC-CM from the perspective of the process of describing
records; IT staff will need to consider the required technology; data
analysts might focus upon the transformations needed to migrate from an
existing data model to a new one.</p>
<p>This learning process might consist of workshops and training courses
on RiC-CM; of exploring the rest of these Application Guidelines;
reading documentation of and experimenting with existing implementations
of RiC: or comparing RiC with existing standards that were used
previously in your organization (e.g. ISAD(G), EAC-CPF, or EAD). See <a
href="mappings.html">§5</a> for more on the latter.</p>
<p>Learning RiC will allow a more concrete impression of what a RiC
implementation might consist of, for everybody involved. It will open
the door to a preliminary and high-level gap analysis between existing
practice (metadata, relations, data structures, software) and your
desired outcomes. You might use your knowledge to design a roadmap
divided into short, medium, and longer-term milestones.</p>
<p>Having a clear view of what implementing RiC will require, you will
be able to realistically assess what will be required to achieve your
objectives — people, time, and a budget — and an assessment of the
risks. The economic dimension is important, since as in any such
circumstances, the dreams may be many, but resources may be few - goals
may need to be prioritised. Key performance indicators might be defined.
Potential resource savings from implementing RiC could be brought into
the economic rationale, along with added value more generally. All of
these elements can contribute to building a business case.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.6" id="map-your-legacy-data-to-ric"><span
class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Map your legacy data to
Ri<span class="end-of-section-heading">C<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>In many cases, implementation of RiC will be made in an environment
where legacy data exists. In order to migrate into a new system
compatible with RiC, your data will need to be prepared and improved.
During this process, RiC-O can be used as a tool, <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology">providing</a> RiC-CM’s
entities, attributes, and relations in the form of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language">OWL</a>
classes, datatype properties, and object properties respectively.</p>
<p>Specifically, a migration of legacy data might involve defining a
one-to-one mapping from old standards to RiC-O classes and properties.
The data would be mapped as closely as possible as-is to RiC-O, or,
where necessary, to an extension of RiC-O accommodating local
requirements. This is the simplest kind of migration; it might later be
complemented by data processing, or one might carry out the latter at
the same time.</p>
<p>In contrast to previous descriptive standards like ISAD(G) which rely
heavily on free-text narrative description, RiC is an entity-relation
model: it identifies the things to be described and how they relate to
each other, and is far more structured. To get the most out of legacy
data, you may need to do some work identifying structure within your
existing descriptions, extracting as many RiC entities as possible, and
linking them using RiC relations. See <a
href="getting_started_with_ric.html">§2</a> for an example of this
approach.</p>
<p>Since the migration and improvement of legacy data is likely to be a
gradual process, it may be a good idea early on — for example as part of
a pilot project as discussed earlier — to gather a subset of data that
encompasses all of the attributes and relations in RiC-CM that you
anticipate that you will have a need for. As you scale up, you will
hopefully then avoid encountering a new requirement that throws a
spanner in the works of your implementation.</p>
<p>Even if you do not immediately have a need for certain attributes or
relations, a good option when migrating might be to leave open as far as
possible — in code and in processes — the possibility of future
improvements to your data, either for new data or through processing of
existing data, which might allow for, or indeed necessitate, use of more
of RiC.</p>
<p>However you proceed, once you have scripts and other tools and
processes to transform your legacy metadata (EAD, CSV, and so on) into
RiC compliant formats (RDF or JSON-LD for instance), test them robustly
with diverse examples, and don’t hesitate to ask for feedback from the
RiC community.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.7" id="a-new-way-of-thinking"><span
class="header-section-number">3.7</span> A new way of thinkin<span class="end-of-section-heading">g<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>A RiC implementation has at least two facets: methodological —
describing records — and technical: a RiC compatible information system
which stores, maintains, and possibly publishes your descriptions. Let
us begin with methodology.</p>
<p>In contrast to previous ICA standards, RiC is not a prescriptive,
ready-to-use standard, but rather a framework — a conceptual model. As
we have emphasized, it will be necessary to understand and define how
RiC can be made to work for you.</p>
<p>Although migration was our focus <a
href="#map-your-legacy-data-to-ric">above</a>, RiC is not simply about
formatting existing data, or changing the way this data is presented to
users. It also bears upon the writing of new descriptions, by humans or
a machine. Whilst the latter might be programmed to perform the task in
a certain way, an archivist/records manager has a mindset, and a way of
describing records, that might need to be adjusted somewhat to reflect
RiC.</p>
<p>Changes to software tools may need to be grappled with in the actual
writing of descriptions. Minor updates to a graphical user interface
might suffice, or more major adaptations may be involved, for instance
if descriptions are written at a lower, more technical level, say EAD
descriptions.</p>
<p>From a strictly methodological perspective, describing with RiC may
continue to be performed quite similarly to in a classical hierarchical
(e.g. ISAD(G)) context: there is an object of description that must be
characterized using certain properties. A Record Set in RiC has
different attributes and relations available for a file, say, than
ISAD(G), but many such differences be overcome by intermediary software,
for example the design of a graphical user interface.</p>
<p>Discernible changes of perspective may arise if the use of relations
in RiC is embraced for expression of information included in previous
elements of description. Your description processes may then enter into
a transitional phase; a hierarchical approach may still sometimes be
taken, but as one way of relating Record Sets and other entities amongst
several, all equal in importance and validity. A separating out of
attributes and relations referring to Instantiation of Records may be
embarked upon.</p>
<p>Relations between Record Resources may be introduced top-down or
bottom-up. In the bottom-up approach, a Record Set might be introduced
when enough Records have something in common that it makes sense to
extract this into an aggregating principle. Having too many Records
aggregating into the same Record Set might, though, eventually prove
cumbersome and time-consuming, and the old approach of dividing large
Record Sets into smaller ones might be employed. In this case, the
ISAD(G) requirement that archival arrangement must be carried out prior
to description may still be relevant, even though this is not mandatory
in RiC.</p>
<p>Moving beyond a transitional period, RiC allows for a variety of
approaches to description, in which the advantages RiC has will become
more apparent. For instance, if an element of the context of a Record
Resource has an aspect that is particularly significant, it might be
used as a starting point for the description of it. For a first example,
let’s assume that we have a corpus of Records illustrating a specific
place. Using the Place entity, the description may begin with the
latter, e.g. documenting it both spatially (subdivisions, adjacent
places,…) and temporally (historical evolution), before describing and
linking the Records themselves to it.</p>
<p>Take instead as an example the description of events such as the
creation of the European Union as agreed in the Maastricht Treaty of
1992. We might introduce an Event entity, relating it along a temporal
axis to other Events such as the Schengen Agreement of 1985, and linking
it to Agents such as army divisions (Group), physical people (Person),
and then placing Records into this rich context.</p>
<p>In summary, establishing methodologies for implementing RiC will
likely involve consideration of the entities in RiC which you wish to
use in your organization, based both requirements that already exists
and evolution of your descriptive practices in the future. It is
important to consider this extensibility aspect, and neither to impose
rules that are too rigid, nor to be too constrained by what your current
software allows.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.8" id="introduce-ric-in-your-software"><span
class="header-section-number">3.8</span> Introduce RiC in your
softwar<span class="end-of-section-heading">e<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>Let us turn to the latter point; the technological aspect of
implementation of RiC. This presents several challenges, pertaining both
to IT industry aspects and the requirements of such an
implementation.</p>
<p>Software implementing RiC might be developed bespoke — whether
in-house or by an external company — or purchased as or within a
commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) product. As always, the former approach
is more flexible, allowing for tailoring to your specific needs, but has
a higher cost both for development and maintenance; it will take longer
before it is able to be used; and it may not benefit from broader
experience of good solutions implemented in other environments. A COTS
product too, though, may require non-trivial configuration, and relying
on a vendor is not risk-free: if the client base is not large, delays
may be encountered, and customization or new functionality may require
dedicated development, which again is cost-intensive. In practice, the
most common approach is to buy from a third-party vendor, in which you
will need to prepare your requirements carefully, for instance based
upon use of RiC-O, and ensure that your vendor can and will implement
them.</p>
<p>RiC compatible software can either replace an existing system or be
implemented from scratch. One might consider gradually implementing RiC
functionality in different domains: managing, describing, or publishing,
for example. We outline a few scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you might first upgrade your publication portal. Even if using an
information system based on traditional description in your backend, a
new portal based upon RiC may illustrate the benefits it brings, and be
a trigger for using it more broadly. Such an approach would involve
something akin to a <a href="#map-your-legacy-data-to-ric">migration of
legacy data</a>, perhaps in the form of on-the-fly conversion of it to
RiC, facilitating viewing and working with it from a multidimensional
perspective.</p></li>
<li><p>a two-phase scenario might be followed along lines discussed <a
href="#a-new-way-of-thinking">above</a>: first, a one-to-one <a
href="#map-your-legacy-data-to-ric">migration</a> of existing data RiC,
and second, the gradual introduction of additional descriptive and
functional possibilities offered by RiC, so that your staff experience
as smooth a transition as possible</p></li>
<li><p>you might instead begin by introducing new functionalities based
on RiC alongside existing ones, firstly implementing the same
functionality as before, but with RiC in the background; then adding
functionality that your staff and users see an immediate need for and
would be popular; finally introducing more innovative
functionality.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The quality and range of functionality of your software will be a
game-changer for transitioning to RiC in your descriptive processes.
Functionality suggesting and semi-automating the creation of relations
between entities, or integration with controlled vocabularies, would be
an invaluable assistance. Since RiC encompasses considerably more
entities than Records and Record Sets, the workflows of your software
and the arrangement of these entities in user interfaces will play an
important role in change and adoption: an archivist or records manager
wishes to capture an object of description, not concern themself
directly with RiC entities, whilst users will be looking for
information, not for RiC entities specifically — the technicalities
should be under the hood.</p>
<p>No particular technology or infrastructure is prescribed for
implementing RiC. As discussed <a
href="#map-your-legacy-data-to-ric">above</a>, RiC-O might prove a
useful and efficient tool, in which case infrastructure such as a
triple-store or graph database might be appropriate. But you should be
able to implement RiC-CM in an SQL database or using XML documents too.
Keep in mind scalability and potential future use-cases, though — a
relational database may not be optimal when working with networks of
relations which are several steps deep, or when it comes to introducing
new entities, attributes, or relations into the database schema.</p>
<p>As in any such case, an implementation project will necessitate
training of staff and users, and changes in management processes. In the
end, software and the technical use of RiC is just a tool; the <a
href="#a-new-way-of-thinking">mindset</a> of archivists/records managers
and users is more important.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Start small! Pilot projects are useful both to assess the process
and its benefits. It is OK to fail, but at the least possible
cost!</p></li>
<li><p>Go one step at a time! The process may take time, and you can
proceed in stages.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you have staff with the requisite skills, including
technical skills, or train them to acquire these skills. Neither
archivists/records managers nor software engineers and IT staff alone
can achieve a successful implementation of RiC alone, it is a question
of teamwork.</p></li>
<li><p>Every situation is different! Understand your use case, set your
goals, and identify the benefits you envision. RiC is not a fashion, but
a tool to help you do your job.</p></li>
<li><p>Take the time to evaluate your data and your situation.</p></li>
<li><p>You are not alone. Ask the RiC community for help (and share your
experience). The RiC <a
href="https://groups.google.com/g/Records_in_Contexts_users/">mailing
list</a> is a good place for this. RiC is a framework that others are
using, so tell people what you are doing - you may find others who are
doing the same. Sharing your experience will help other people.</p></li>
<li><p>Implementations are still at an early stage, but some exist, as
do tools. See the RiC <a
