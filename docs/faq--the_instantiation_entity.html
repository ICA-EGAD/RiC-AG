<p>The introduction of the Instantiation entity, and the distinction
between an Instantiation and a Record Resource, is one of the novelties
of RiC. We <a
href="#do-i-have-an-instantiation-or-a-record-resource">begin</a> by
offering some guidance, including several simple examples, upon how to
tell whether one is describing an Instantiation or a Record Resource.
This section is appropriate for a beginner in RiC.</p>
<p>An important aspect of the Record Resource versus Instantiation
distinction in RiC is that the same Record Resource might have multiple
Instantiations, often derived from one another. It can happen that,
eventually at least, we regard an Instantiation as representing a new
Record. The <a
href="#when-does-a-derived-instantiation-represent-a-new-record">second</a>
section discusses this; it is appropriate for an intermediate to
advanced user of RiC.</p>
<p>In the <a href="#instantiations-of-record-sets">final</a> section, we
discuss the fact that a Record Set need not have an Instantiation,
taking the documentary heritage of Charles Darwin as an example. This
section would be appropriate for a beginner to intermediate user of
RiC.</p>
<h2 data-number="6c.2"
id="do-i-have-an-instantiation-or-a-record-resource"><span
class="header-section-number">6c.2</span> Do I have an Instantiation or a
Record Resource<span class="end-of-section-heading">?<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>As soon as archivists began to make use of reproduction techniques
like photographing, microfilming and scanning, the same Record Resource
could be accessed through different materialisations. This is very
convenient for users of an archive, but results in an extra need to keep
track of the relations between the ‘original’ and its reproductions.
Furthermore, in a digital archive the same report could be stored in
various ways, ‘locations’, and formats.</p>
<p>To capture the relations between these various
materialisations/representations, RiC-CM introduced the concept of
Instantiation. One Record Resource could have multiple Instantiations,
but a Record or Record Part must have at least one (a Record Set need
not; we shall return to this point <a
href="#instantiations-of-record-sets">below</a>). An Instantiation does
not exist without a Record Resource. The Record Resource is the
(abstract) thing that is materialised into a (concrete) Instantiation.
This compares to how libraries in the latest standard model
publications: a book is a (concrete) Item which is only one of a big
heap of printed things capturing a certain (abstract) Work.</p>
<p>Knowing whether you are describing a Record Resource or an
Instantiation might be answered with the question: is the archival
metadata you want to capture about the concrete, physical thing, or does
it describe an aspect that is independent of the way it is materialised?
In the first case you’re describing an Instantiation, in the second a
Record Resource.</p>
<p><em>Do you want to capture archival metadata that says that the text
on a piece of paper is written by the Queen?</em> Record Resource. If
you scan the piece of paper, both the text on the paper and the scan are
written by the Queen. This metadata is independent of whether we
describe the piece of paper or the scan.</p>
<p><em>Do you want to capture archival metadata that says that the thing
is printed on paper?</em> Instantiation. “Made of paper” is a property
of the physical thing. Scanning the thing results in a new, second
Instantiation of the same Record Resource.</p>
<p><em>Do you want to capture what resolution was used to scan a piece
of paper?</em> Instantiation. If you were to scan the same Record a
second time with a different resolution (and thus create a further
Instantiation), you would store the different resolutions with the
different Instantiations: the resolution is a property of the physical
representation that you are describing.</p>
<p><em>Do you want to capture archival metadata about the administrative
process (Activity) that produced the Record?</em> Record Resource.
Whether you find a printed copy or the original Word version of a Record
in the (hybrid) Record Set you are describing, they are both the result
of the same administrative process: the metadata is independent of
whether the record is the printed variant of the Word file or not.</p>
<h2 data-number="6c.3"

class="header-section-number">6c.3</span> When does a derived
Instantiation represent a new Record<span class="end-of-section-heading">?<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>As RiC-CM puts it in the Scope Notes for the Instantiation
entity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Depending on the context, a new instantiation may represent a new
record resource or the same record resource.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An example is given there, to which we refer the reader. For another,
consider the case that we have a Record whose original Instantiation is
a digital file. Suppose that this file is duplicated; the duplicate
might initially simply be regarded as representing the same Record. But
it might be used by a researcher as source material, so that the
duplicate can be regarded as (an Instantiation of) a Record of that
researcher’s endeavours. Or, for instance, it might be used within a
criminal investigation, and become regarded as (an Instantiation of) a
Record of that investigation. We illustrate this possibility in the
diagram below.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/duplicate_representing_a_new_record.svg"><img
src="diagrams/duplicate_representing_a_new_record.svg"
alt="Duplicate representing a new record" /></a></p>
<p>A rule of thumb might be that if an Instantiation is derived from
another with the intention of being used for the same purpose, but has
other properties (inscribed upon a different medium, or easier to read,
say), and this derivation is a largely mechanistic process without
intellect significantly being brought to bear, then the derived
Instantiation might not be thought of as representing more than the
original Record. For instance, a scanning of a Record which is an
analogue photograph to an image file might simply be regarded as a new
Instantiation of the original Record. Whereas if the photograph is
digitized to a file format such as TIFF which allows making annotations,
and this functionality is made use of, we might consider that it
represents a new Record; see towards the end of <a
href="faq--how_to_describe_activities_such_as_digitization_appraisal_or_disposition.html#digitization">§6d.2</a>
for an example of this, including a diagram which we now reproduce.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/digitization--new_record.svg"><img
src="diagrams/digitization--new_record.svg"
alt="Digitization resulting in new record" /></a></p>
<p>This example illustrates that whether an Instantiation is regarded as
representing a new Record may be time-dependent: until it is annotated,
the TIFF file might be regarded only as representing the original
Record, but once annotations are made and the file acquires a history of
its own, we might then regard it as representing a new Record. See <a
href="faq--record_or_record_set.html#time-dependence">§6b.2.3</a> for
more on sensitivity to time in RiC, this being an important aspect.</p>
<p>Transcription or translation, whether by human or artifical
intelligence, is an in-between case. Aspects such as who or what carried
it out, the kind of training or experience they or it received, when it
took place, and assessments of accuracy, might be modelled as
meta-metadata/paradata Records arising out of, and documenting, the
transcription or translation activity itself, not having a direct
bearing upon the question of whether we have a representation of a new
Record. See <a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#do-you-have-examples-illustrating-chapter-6-of-ric-cm">§6a.3.4</a>
for example.</p>
<p>But there are other cases, such as when the transcription or
translation has semantic markup, e.g. is in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative">TEI
format</a>, or, again, when the output is annotated with comments, where
we might consider that this represents a new Record. In line with much
of the discussion of <a href="faq--record_or_record_set.html">§6b</a>,
we might also choose to regard a transcription or translation as a new
Record when, for instance, we wish to emphasize the transcriber or
translator’s role: this might be in the context of consideration of the
transcriber or translator’s work more generally; or in a context in
which the possibility of bias is a particularly sensitive one; or one of
several other possibilities.</p>
<h2 data-number="6c.4" id="instantiations-of-record-sets"><span
class="header-section-number">6c.4</span> Instantiations of Record
Set<span class="end-of-section-heading">s<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>It may be very useful to bring an Instantiation of a Record Set into
one’s descriptive context. A photo collection might, for instance, be
instantiated as a digital photo album. RiC does not, though, require
that a Record Set have an Instantiation. Let us discuss this a
little.</p>
<p>Distinguishing between an archive and its physical arrangement might
at one time have been thought artifical. However, digital material,
especially digital-born material, radically challenges that perspective;
in several ways, but not least the fact that it is metadata that under
the hood sews together file systems together: a single digital file
might be stored in two or more — to all intents and purposes random —
locations.</p>
<p>One arrives at the idea of considering groupings/aggregations of
records that are meaningful intellectually, but not reflected in a
physical assembly of material. The private documentary heritage of
Charles Darwin, for instance, is <a
href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/charles-darwin-archive-recognised-by-unesco">held</a>
across at least six institutions.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/darwin_record_set.svg"><img
src="diagrams/darwin_record_set.svg"
alt="Darwin’s documentary heritage" /></a></p>
<p>This situation can equally well occur for public bodies, a typical
cause being the merging and splitting of such bodies or sub-entities of
them.</p>
<p>The freedom to form purely intellectual aggregations in a descriptive
context is often very useful in practice. See for instance <a
href="case_study--how_might_ric_be_of_use_to_indigenous_communities_and_other_minority_groups.html#challenging-over-reliance-on-sources">§7.3</a>,
<a
href="case_study--how_might_ric_be_of_use_to_indigenous_communities_and_other_minority_groups.html#weaving-together-fragments">§7.5</a>,
and <a
href="extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote.html#records-of-the-council-of-castile-i">§8.5</a>.</p>
