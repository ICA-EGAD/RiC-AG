<p>People who are looking for information don’t think that much about
how that information is stored. They just want to find the information
quickly and efficiently, and to assess its quality and authenticity.
With the World Wide Web, and Linked Data in particular, archives have
the opportunity to move from siloed architectures towards data driven
structures. For the archival field, Records in Contexts is the means to
achieve that. This part of the Application Guidelines looks at the
benefits of RiC for end users, archival practitioners and managers in
archival institutions respectively. After reading this part you should
know why it is worthwhile to invest in understanding and using RiC.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="for-end-users"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> For end user<span class="end-of-section-heading">s<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>The benefit for end users comes mostly from the network structure
that is one of the foundations of RiC. After all, records may not only
be related through a common provenance, but may also be related to
common people and places. This makes it easier for end users to answer
questions like: ‘what archival material is available about my home?’ or
‘what archival material relates to my grandmother?’ or ‘what archival
material relates to healthcare in the 1950s?’.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.1" id="multiple-points-of-access"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Multiple points of
access</h3>
<p>RiC ensures that multiple routes to information are created.
Currently you need to know exactly where archived information is in
order to find it, or you need to know who created the records –
something that is not usually intuitive for a member of the public.
Thanks to RiC’s network structure it is possible to use relationships to
get to certain information independent of where it is held. With RiC
based metadata, any RiC entity (such as a Person or a Place) can become
an access point alongside the hierarchical structure of an original
finding aid. So, in addition to drilling down from the fonds to the
record, browsing via persons and places becomes much more effective as
they are part of a network of data and documented relationships. That
network could be between archival resources within one repository, but
also linked to data somewhere else, outside of your institution. Related
content may include, for example, collections by the same creator held
at different institutions, collections by members of the same family
held at the same or different institutions, or collections relating to
the same event held at the same or different institutions.</p>
<p>Because multiple avenues of access are offered, more types of users
can reach archival material and, depending what the data is linked to,
even users who are not specifically looking for archival material can
find it too.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.2.2" id="use-the-context-of-information"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Use the context of
information</h3>
<p>Using Records in Contexts creates a network of data, which makes data
better contextualized. The data is no longer presented in isolation
(like the old silos of finding aids, indexes and image databases), but
always related to other sources, people or places, which leads to a
better understanding of the data. As a result, the data becomes more
meaningful.</p>
<p>The network structure of RiC also enables new visualizations of
search results. We’re already familiar with the table (when the metadata
is most important), the timeline (when chronology is most important) and
the map (when geography is most important). For the user who is
interested in the relationships between the people, places, events and
records that form the network, the representation (or visualization) of
this network of related entities as a graph can be very helpful. It
enables you to browse or explore such a network by following a trail of
nodes that are of interest.</p>

id="facilitate-methods-of-analysis-and-connection"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Facilitate methods of
analysis and connection</h3>
<p>When you combine RiC with Linked Data techniques you can infer
information that your local system doesn’t know. Linked Data is a way of
expressing information in statements following the pattern
‘subject/predicate/object’, as in ‘William Shakespeare (subject) is the
author of (predicate) Macbeth (object).’ RiC implemented as Linked Data
adds benefits to resource discovery, in particular the ability to
include data that is not stored locally but is available in a related
record elsewhere. For example, another system might store the statement
‘Macbeth was published in 1623’. When linked to the entity ‘Macbeth’,
both pieces of information–authorship and publication date of
Macbeth–can become available to the same system despite originating in
separate systems.</p>
<p>When RiC is combined with Linked Data techniques it is ideally suited
for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>selecting data: doing research with your own specific, dedicated
subset</p></li>
<li><p>combining data: relating the research data with data available in
other sources</p></li>
<li><p>inferring data: using the available, standardized rules in RiC-O
or creating your own rules to add data that can be deduced from the
existing metadata</p></li>
<li><p>keeping track of references: storing the origin of the data for
future researchers to study</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although these activities can be carried out using existing
techniques, Linked Data makes it possible to perform them more precisely
and will provide more data for the same or less effort. Increasingly,
researchers are looking for technical ways to use archival sources, and
RiC enables these approaches to be used alongside the traditional
methods. As a result, more people will be able to find and use your
archival material.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.3" id="for-archival-practitioners"><span
class="header-section-number">1.3</span> For archival practitioner<span class="end-of-section-heading">s<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>Archival practitioners are passionate about making sure that the
quality of their metadata is high. However, practitioners often
encounter the limits of the existing data model. For example, within a
traditional hierarchical system, a record can be described at only one
position in the hierarchy. Most of the time this position is related to
the arrangement and the provenance of the record (e.g., financial
records are part of the series of records created by the financial
department), and not accessible through the subject (e.g. ‘travel
expenses’ or ‘personnel’) that an end user might want to study. That
means an end user must know how to drill down the hierarchy to discover
the right archival source. With Records in Contexts (note that
‘Contexts’ is plural!) subjects can be added at the same time as the
provenance and the arrangement are added. RiC does not consider these
two elements of context as the only two, as is the case in a hierarchy,
and allows professionals to move from a mono-hierarchical perspective to
a multidimensional description. They no longer have to choose a single
location in a hierarchy for the records they describe, but rather are
invited to represent the network of entities in which these records are
placed.</p>
<p>With born-digital records this problem becomes even more complex: in
a document management system there are all kinds of relations between
records and computer files. Records in Contexts defines clearcut
entities, and relations to connect those entities to each other. These
relations give several points of entry to a record, and also essential
contexts. In a hierarchical system much of this information would get
lost. At best, it is stored in the description, which makes it messy and
difficult to analyse.</p>
<p>Another important benefit is that Records in Contexts introduces new
concepts to model digital and digitised sources. An archival record can
be instantiated more than once, besides its original paper form or
digitally appraised computer file. It makes the conceptual model robust
for the future, while enabling, for instance, all kinds of AI technology
to be used as well. Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) and Optical
Character Recognition are tremendously useful to all kinds of users: you
can search within the data of the record itself. Because in Records in
Contexts the transcript is a separate entity, you can store metadata
about it. When was the transcript made, from which scan, and with which
model? When you have a better HTR model, you can easily select old
versions of the texts to be replaced by new ones. See <a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#do-you-have-examples-illustrating-chapter-6-of-ric-cm">§6a.3.4</a>
for more on this.</p>
<p>The introduction of additional entities like Activity and Rule (see
<a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#are-activity-and-event-central-entities-in-ric-how-about-rule-and-place">§6a.3.2</a>)
provides for nuanced expressions of archival practice, helping the
archivist to model clearly the provenance and the history of archival
material. Such approaches enable a more unified approach to describing
records before and after their transfer to an archival institution.
Metadata captured by records creators can be reused in archival
description systems. Simply put: Records in Contexts makes sure that
metadata is captured where it should be. With more entities, and
properties for those entities, and relations with a specific name, the
practitioner has many more options to describe records in their
contexts.</p>
<p>When you combine RiC with Linked Data you have the opportunity to
integrate all kinds of controlled vocabularies, authority records and
value lists into your system, and to use them to standardize metadata.
Controlled value lists are already in use in the archival field to
varying degrees, but the benefit of the Linked Data technique is that it
is so much more interoperable with other sources. As an archivist you
can use this to benefit from other people’s work. For instance, if a
certain agent is important to your collection, you probably want to
include the name of this person in one of your own lists. You can link
this list to external sources, such as Wikidata. When someone else has
found out the date of birth and death, you can simply import this
information. It saves you the time of researching those dates yourself.
And it prevents redundancy of metadata. The more you standardize, the
more time it saves you. This leads to improved work processes.</p>
<p>Introducing RiC as Linked Data can be realized by using the
standardized RiC Ontology (RiC-O). RiC-O contains all the RiC entities
and its predefined types of properties, called ‘relations’, complemented
by a lot of other entities and properties. Some of these enable you to
provide more accurate descriptions, others enable backwards
compatibility. Using RiC-O to publish your archival metadata helps to
link it with archival description in other heritage institutions and
exchange metadata if necessary, widening the network of data available
to the researcher.</p>

class="header-section-number">1.4</span> For IT managers and CIO<span class="end-of-section-heading">s<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>With Records in Contexts we have one global and consistent reference
model, maintained by and for the professional community which uses it.
It can be used as a way to break down internal silos and design a
data-oriented enterprise architecture. In this architecture, processes
can be organized more efficiently using software components that are
interoperable and easily interchangeable - if the components comply with
the standard. The resulting architecture is better suited to archival
processes and will meet the needs of existing and future end users.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the standard can be introduced
step-by-step following an iterative approach. The implementation can be
organized as a series of modular projects carried out over time. During
these projects the reference model can be extended if needed. For more
on this see <a href="implementation_strategies.html">§3</a>.</p>
<p>Introducing Linked Data and the Records in Contexts Ontology helps
transform the metadata you hold and publish it in a variety of forms
suitable for various needs. It also ensures your organization complies
with international standards for reusable data sets in scientific
research, like <a
href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR</a>.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.5" id="for-general-managers"><span
class="header-section-number">1.5</span> For general manager<span class="end-of-section-heading">s<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>The introduction of Records in Contexts in your organization is worth
the extra effort and resources as it results in greater control of the
ever-increasing amount of data. Through a better understanding of the
components of the data and the software, the quality of the metadata in
your collection improves, as well as the efficiency of the processes
handling it.</p>
<p>Records in Contexts makes your organization ready for the future. New
technologies, like AI, can be hooked into the new infrastructure. For
the first time it provides a framework for describing both born-digital
material and analogue records, and as a result will help with the
processing of both paper and digital records, as well as hybrid
collections, which have grown in recent years. Thirdly, as a common
reference model, Records in Contexts enables connection of your archival
material and data to other organizations, especially if you implement it
in Linked Data, and makes cooperation with these organizations easier.
As RiC is adopted by more organizations, it is likely that funding
partners will require you to introduce RiC into your institution and
project, as a condition for funding.</p>
<p>The transformation of your finding aids from the old standards to
Records in Contexts is a considerable undertaking, and will mean changes
to how you work, but it will improve processes and enable researchers to
use your data in ways that are not possible now. The change will not
happen overnight. Implementing RiC is an iterative process and
approaches to this, along with how to get started, will be described in
the following parts.</p>
