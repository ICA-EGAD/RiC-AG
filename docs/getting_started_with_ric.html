<p>This part of the Application Guidelines demonstrates how you could
get started with RiC using your own data. It takes an existing
ISAD(G)-style catalogue and maps the information to RiC-CM. For more,
see <a href="mappings.html">§5</a>.</p>

class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Introductio<span class="end-of-section-heading">n<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>How do you start using RiC to describe your records? It’s best to
begin small, with just a few pieces of information, creating relations
that are already known and using your existing finding aids if you have
them.</p>
<p>Connections are often hidden in the narrative descriptions and fields
of finding aids, and one of the key purposes of RiC is to make these
connections explicit. These links often reveal new information about our
collections and they could connect our records to others in our own
collections and on the wider web. Creating a network in this way will
also help you spot what information is missing, so could prompt you to
find the information from the depositor (where possible) or for future
deposits to improve your finding aid.</p>
<p>RiC-CM is what is termed a ‘general reference framework’ which means
that it is a structured high-level guide, in this case for the
description of archives. It provides a common vocabulary, best practice
and rules so you can lay the foundations for implementing it in a
consistent way. This means it includes some general elements which can
be used to broadly describe almost every archival collection, with some
more specific elements to describe your records at a more detailed
level. You do not need to use all of the elements from the start - or at
all - and you can add more over time, building your descriptive model
step by step. So which pieces of information do you need? Although
nothing is mandatory in RiC, there are some elements which may be
especially useful for identifying, retrieving, selecting and accessing
records of interest to researchers, for example most entities benefit
from a Name and an Identifier. These are commonly found in archival
finding aids so are likely to be familiar and demonstrate how easy it is
to get started.</p>
<p>Many archives used <a
href="https://www.ica.org/resource/isadg-general-international-standard-archival-description-second-edition/">ISAD(G)</a>
as a basis for their finding aids, either directly, via national
standards, or by using in-house guides taking inspiration from it.
ISAD(G) provides key information about records and specifies that the
<em>reference</em> (i.e. an identifier), <em>title</em>,
<em>creator</em>, <em>date</em>, <em>extent</em> and <em>level</em>
fields are considered essential (for the exchange of information). These
are a great place to start when describing records, and here we will
explore how they can be expressed in RiC.</p>
<p>As archivists and records managers we know that the people and
organizations who created, used and managed the records, their functions
and activities, the records’ different forms, both analogue and digital,
and the relations between all of these things, are essential to
understanding and using archives. RiC gives us a single framework to
describe these records because it encompasses this wider context,
building on both ISAD(G) and the complementary standards <a
href="https://www.ica.org/resource/isaar-cpf-international-standard-archival-authority-record-for-corporate-bodies-persons-and-families-2nd-edition/">ISAAR(CPF)</a>,
<a
href="https://www.ica.org/resource/isdiah-international-standard-for-describing-institutions-with-archival-holdings/">ISDIAH</a>,
and <a
href="https://www.ica.org/resource/isdf-international-standard-for-describing-functions/">ISDF</a>.
In the example below we will cover the key fields but also some of the
broader aspects you are likely to encounter when you start working with
RiC.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.3" id="overview-of-key-ric-elements"><span

Element<span class="end-of-section-heading">s<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>This section groups the entities into the broad questions asked by
users of records, namely ‘what’, ‘who’, ‘when’, ‘where’ and ‘why’.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.3.1"
id="the-what-record-resources-and-instantiations"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> The ‘What’: record resources
and instantiations</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="entities-e03-record-set-e04-record-e05-record-part">Entities: E03
Record Set, E04 Record, E05 Record Part</h4>
<p>Just as with a traditional finding aid, Records in Contexts helps us
describe individual archival records, parts of those records and groups
of records. The entity Record Resource is used to describe these
collectively. In RiC, a Record is a discrete piece of information often
associated with a single transaction, for example a letter, memorandum,
report, photograph or sound recording. A Record Part could describe a
paragraph of text within the Record, or a wax seal attached to a
charter, or an image file attached to an email. A Record Set is an
aggregation of Records, for example, a Fonds or a Series, because they
are both an organized group - or ‘set’ of Records. For RiC a physical
folder containing a number of letters is also a Record Set and reflects
the definition given in ISAD(G): ‘[a]n organized unit of documents
grouped together […] because they relate to the same subject, activity,
or transaction. A file is usually the basic unit within a record
series’. For born-digital records, an ISAD(G) file is often considered
to be a digital folder containing a number of individual digital objects
such as Word or PDF files - again RiC’s definition of a Record Set as an
aggregation of records matches the previous standard.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="entity-e06-instantiation">Entity: E06
Instantiation</h4>
<p>This entity may be the most challenging to understand as it separates
the description of the physical features of the record resource from the
description of the content it contains. ISAD(G) does not make this
distinction but describes both physical and intellectual features of a
record in a single description. The concept of an Instantiation means we
can distinguish between the intellectual content of the Record, such as
the writer of a letter and its content, and the physical form it takes.
For example, the description of the Instantiation of a letter could
include the Carrier Extent (e.g. A4 size) and Carrier Type (paper), and
the Production Technique: handwriting. A description of the
Instantiation of a digital letter might include its Instantiation Extent
(1.4MB), its Carrier Type (optical disk). A single record could have
multiple Instantiations, for example the letter written on paper could
have been scanned and a digital Instantiation created as a PDF file.
With RiC we can describe both the PDF and the paper Instantiations of
the letter and link them both to a single description of the Record.
This allows us to be more specific in what we are describing and more
efficient as we only need to describe the content once rather than
duplicate the description for both entries.</p>
<p>In RiC every Record and Record Part has or had at least one
Instantiation because they will always have a physical aspect even if it
no longer exists, for example we might have a description of a charter
from an old finding aid which has been lost or destroyed since the
finding aid was created. This makes sense if we think of the
Instantiation as the ‘object’ we hold in the archive. In most cases we
will be able to say something about the Instantiation of a Record, for
example, where it can be consulted or whether it is born-digital,
digitised or analogue.</p>
<p>As you would expect, Instantiations are linked by a relationship to
Records, for example a digitised version of a photograph or a military
service record is linked to the description of its intellectual content.
But Instantiations can also be linked to Record Sets, for example if the
lowest level of description is a physical folder containing many
individual letters, the instantiation would describe the physical
characteristics of that folder as a whole and if the letters were then
digitised as a single PDF, that PDF would be described as an
instantiation of the Record Set.</p>
<p>For a more detailed discussion of the distinctions between Records,
Record Sets and Instantiations see RiC-CM v1 Section 2.2.2.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.3.2" id="the-who-people-and-organizations"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> The ‘Who’: people and
organizations</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="entity-e07-agent-e11-corporate-body">Entity:
E07 Agent / E11 Corporate Body</h4>
<p>Archivists often struggle to create a single hierarchy for a series
which has been created or managed by more than one person or
organization as prescribed by the principle of Respect des Fonds with
ISAD(G). Knowing which individuals, families or organizations created,
held, used and maintained the records over time is essential but does
not always reflect the social and material complexity of the records’
origin. RiC recognizes that provenance can be understood in various ways
and enables us to represent the complex network of relations that
surround every record over time. To do this the entity of Agent has an
equal standing with the Record and Record Sets and can indicate that
they were created by more than one person or group, and that those
persons or groups have played different roles depending on their
functions and mandates.</p>
<p>In the example below, we have used Corporate Body (a fourth level
entity) instead of Agent (a second level and ‘core’ entity) because it
is more specific. This is an easy choice to make if you know the type of
creators and choosing the more specific elements means your descriptions
will be less ambiguous.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.3.3"
id="the-when---the-temporal-context-were-describing"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> The ‘When’ - the temporal
context we’re describing</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="entity-e18-date">Entity: E18 Date</h4>
<p>One of the differences between RiC-CM and ISAD(G) is that RiC-CM is
an entity relationship model, meaning that it views entities and the
relations between them as just as important as the records. Dates are
therefore treated as entities in RiC as they are key to understanding
the records. This means we can describe the temporal context of the
other entities instead of just adding a date as an attribute,
i.e. information about an entity.</p>
<p>By making the date an entity we can be far more explicit about what
it means. Is it the date of creation or a date that is associated with
the contents of the record? Is it from the Gregorian or Julian calendar?
Is it only an approximation? Is it not just the date of creation but a
significant date that is relevant to the record? By making the date an
entity we can make its relation to the Record, Agent or Record Set
really clear, For example, the Date entity 8th May 1945 can be linked to
a Person entity with a relation of ‘is death date of’ but it can also be
linked to a Record with the relation ‘is creation date of’ and given a
name ‘Victory in Europe (VE) Day’ and linked to an Event entity: the day
that the Second World War in Europe ended. By treating date as an entity
we can link it to a variety of other entities and see potential links
between them all: a Person, a Record and an Event.</p>
<p>As archival data are increasingly used for computational purposes,
modelling dates as entities rather than attributes ensures they are
machine-readable as well as meaningful for humans. Simple dates in
existing finding aids, such as ‘12 October 1958’ or ‘1978-1980’ can be
used in the Expressed date attribute. Many finding aids. however, have
dates such as ‘c.1650’ or ‘1920s’ or ‘17th century’. We can still use
those dates in RiC in the Expressed date attribute but we can also
define them in a machine readable way in the Normalized date attribute.
They might become 1650-01-01/1650-12-31, 1920-01-01/1929-12-31 and
1600-01-01/1699-12-31 (or 1601-01-01/1700-12-31, depending upon how one
defines a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century">century</a>),
and can then be found by database searches.</p>

2.2.6.</p>

id="the-where-the-location-were-describing"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3.4</span> The ‘Where’: the location
we’re describing</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="entity-e22-place">Entity: E22 Place</h4>
<p>Records are created in places, are about places and are held in
places All of this information is usefulto researchers, so RiC provides
a way of describing any place to any level of detail alongside how it
relates to the Record Resource.</p>
<p>For a more detailed discussion of Place see RiC-CM v1 Section
2.2.7.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.3.5"
id="the-why-the-reason-for-the-record-resources-existence"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3.5</span> The ‘Why’: the reason for the
Record Resource’s existence</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="entity-e15-activity">Entity: E15
Activity</h4>
<p>An activity is a kind of event performed by an agent, and in many
archival contexts this means it is the same as a function. Instead of
using the term function, however, RiC uses the term Activity because
some types of Agent, such as a Person or a Family, do not perform
functions in the traditional archival sense.</p>
<p>For a more detailed discussion of Activity see RiC-CM v1 Section
2.2.4.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.3.6" id="attributes"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3.6</span> Attributes</h3>
<p>Every entity in RiC including Records, Record Sets and Instantiations
has a list of attributes. These attributes reflect characteristics of
the records such as the description, the unique reference number and the
access conditions. Some of these attributes can be filled in as free
text, while others can be chosen from a set of predefined terms, for
example physical formats (CD, box etc.) or authority terms.</p>
<p>For a more detailed discussion of attributes see RiC-CM v1 Section
3.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.3.7" id="relations"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3.7</span> Relations</h3>
<p>Relations are key to RiC: with relations we can create a rich network
of connections with explicit links between all the entities including
Records, Record Sets, Instantiations and Agents. With a relation, one to
many Instantiations can be linked to the same Record so it is clear that
they convey the same content. The Instantisations can also be linked to
each other, to say for example that a digital instantiation is derived
from an analogue one. Relations also link Records and Record Sets, so
that the hierarchy and the sequences used in traditional finding aids
can be maintained. Relations can also link entities outside of the
traditional hierarchy. This makes it possible to link parts of our
collections for a variety of reasons including similar content, or
because they were used by the same individual, or relate to the same
legislation or event, or because they document the same activity or
chain of activities. Outside of our institution, we can use relations to
link our records to those held by other archives. In time, these
connections will form a huge network, describing the multiple contexts
in which archival documents have been created and managed. For users
this could expand the horizons of their research as the connections
could extend far beyond those in a traditional finding aid.</p>
<p>For a more detailed discussion of relations see RiC-CM v1 Section
5.</p>

<p>This simple example shows how part of an existing finding aid - based
on ISAD(G), ISAAR(CPF), and with a few additional entities - can be
turned into RiC-CM. The example is taken from <a
href="https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C405">Discovery</a>,
the online finding aid of the National Archives, UK. To create this
example we have included metadata from the catalogue and supplemented it
with data that is not included in the current catalogue such as
Instantiation and Activity.</p>
<p>We have included some frequently used fields such as identifier,
name, language and dates, and added some which would be included from
ISAAR(CPF), ISDIAH and ISDF to demonstrate how RiC incorporates all of
the earlier ICA standards. In addition we have included a link to
Wikidata to illustrate how a finding aid can be extended beyond its
traditional boundaries to an external source of information.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important point to take from this section is that
once learnt, using RiC to describe your collections will not take more
time or be more difficult than your current processes.</p>

</table>
<p>This choice of elements may be missing some you feel are important,
such as Scope and content and History. These are usually considered core
for traditional finding aids as some kind of free-text description is
usual for a large Record set. If you have this information it can be
used as it stands but <em>in addition</em>, you can also structure the
information so that the Linked Data technologies can read it and find
those hidden connections. You can do this by creating subjects linked to
instances of Thing with the relation <em>is or was subject of</em>, for
the topics that the Record Set or the Record relate to.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could use several instances of Event, related to
the Record set or Record using the Relation <em>affects or
affected</em>, to link events that are relevant to the history of the
Record Resource. So RiC is flexible: you can start with the less
structured elements and refine your finding aid by adding more elements
over time, keeping both the narrative text alongside the individual
instances of events or topics to make it clearer how they link to the
Record Resource. In this way RiC allows you to keep a broader history
<em>and</em> include more structured information at specific record
level, which is often missing completely in some finding aids. If you
have this information, then include it, perhaps splitting it up into
different elements such as functions, mandates, agents and dates linked
by relations.</p>
<p>The tables below can be tricky to interpret, so the first entity
includes a brief explanation of how to read the tables as natural

id="entity-of-type-record-set-e03-the-records-created-or-inherited-by-the">Entity
of type Record Set E03: The Records created or inherited by the</h4>
<p>Bodies for Devolved Government in Wales</p>
<p>This entity includes the most commonly used relations to link it to
other entities. Some of the differences between RiC and ISAD(G) become
obvious here, for example the Creator is not an attribute of the fonds
but an entity in its own right. This means that once we create an entity
for the Welsh Assembly Government with its own attributes such as dates
of existence and history, as well as related agents with dates of the
relations etc, it can be linked to this fonds and to any number of other
entities.</p>
<p>This example also shows how a Record Set’s dates are described as an
entity so that those dates can be expressed in both machine- and
human-readable formats and even gives them an identifier in order to be
able to (uniquely) refer to them.</p>
<p>The final relation shows how a fonds is linked to its series. A
relation is used to show that the fonds includes specific series. In
this example we show only one of those series: WA 16.</p>
<p>The tables can be difficult to interpret so it’s easiest to think of
the information as simple sentences as you read through it. In the table
below the fonds is the entity - as indicated by the text in the first
row. Every attribute and relation refers to that fonds so it can be read
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The entity has the Record Set Type of ‘Fonds’</p></li>
<li><p>The fonds has the identifier ‘WA’</p></li>
<li><p>The fonds has the name ‘Records created or inherited by the
Bodies for Devolved Government in Wales’</p></li>
<li><p>The fonds is made up of records in the language
‘English’</p></li>
<li><p>The fonds is made up of records that have the access condition
‘Open’</p></li>
<li><p>The fonds includes or included a Record Set with the name ‘London
2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games: Digital and Paper Records’ and the
identifier ‘WA 16’</p></li>
<li><p>The fonds has or had an owner with the name ‘The National
Archives’ and the identifier ‘66’</p></li>
<li><p>The fonds has a creator with the name ‘Welsh Government’ and the
identifier of ‘GB/NNAF/C287344’ etc…</p></li>

<p>Note that this and any date entity could be reused by another entity
with the same span such as another Record Set (such as a Series or
Fonds) or an Agent (such as a Corporate Body or Person).</p>
<p>To create links each entity needs an identifier. Giving an identifier
to a Date seems unusual if you are used to working with an ISAD(G) style
catalogue especially as a date is always a property of a Record or a
Record Set. In RiC, a date is an entity, just like a Record Set, a
Record or an Agent because it is something we want to describe in more
detail. We may want to say that this is only an approximate date, or
that there is a human or computer readable version of the date also
supplied. If each date was only a property we would have no way of
adding that information using RiC-CM.</p>
<p>As Date is an entity each one in the catalogue or finding aid needs
an identifier so it can link to other entities such as Records and
Record Sets. This can be randomly generated, although using letters
rather than numbers is less confusing. You will see in TNA’s catalogue
that dates are properties, so the identifiers in the example were
invented.</p>
<p>Note that only the relation indicates the kind of date for the
described entity. For example it could be the creation date of a Record
Set or an Instantiation, the birth date of a Person or the date a Record
will be open to the public.</p>

<p>The following two tables describe a born-digital record and an
instantiation of it. Many of the attributes are the same: both have an
identifier and a name and they are both linked to the same date with the
relation <em>is creation date of</em>. One of the differences is the
extent attributes where the attribute is specific to the entity. The
Record is described in terms that make sense to a human using it: as one
digital record. The Instantiation is described in terms of the digital
storage size of this specific file: one megabyte.</p>
<p>Note that the same attribute can mean something different when
applied to different entities. In this example the Conditions of Access
of ‘Open’ for the Instantiation means primarily that this actual file
can be viewed by anyone, whereas for the Record it could mean that there
are no ‘intellectual’ obstacles preventing it being available, for
example no privacy issues or withholding of permission to view from the
owner. Alternatively, the Conditions of Access for the Record might be
‘Open’ but for the Instantiation it could be ‘Closed’ if, for example,
the format was obsolete and there was currently no technology available
to read the file. If the record was physical the Record could be ‘Open’
but the Instantiation could be ‘Closed’ because it is too fragile to
produce.</p>

<p>Extent is a good example of where RiC-CM may not give you the
granularity you want when you come to implement your new RiC finding aid
as Linked Data. The example above uses the Record Resource Extent
attribute to hold the short sentence ‘approx image size 1 MB’ which may
be enough for most users. But what if someone is researching email
archives and wants to know the average size of an email in this series
or in your whole collection. To answer this question, you would need to
split the digit from the rest of the text and then identify the unit of
measurement using the RiC-O <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#InstantiationExtent"><u>Instantiation
Extent</u></a> class. This allows you to describe the extent as an
entity of its own with separate properties for ‘quantity’ and
‘unitOfMeasurement’.</p>

<p>This section gives an idea of how RiC-CM could be used with an
ISAD(G) style finding aid. You can see that it is easy to map the fields
between the two approaches, and once this has been completed for your
finding aid (or just a part of it), you can progress to putting the data
into RiC-O and realising the benefits described in <a
href="what_are_the_benefits_of_using_ric.html">§1</a> by building the
network of links.</p>
