<p>Records in Contexts-Application Guidelines (RiC-AG) is the last of
four complementary documents that address the activity of describing
records. The first three parts, published in 2023, are <a
href="https://www.ica.org/resource/records-in-contexts-foundations-of-archival-description/">Records
in Contexts–Foundations of Archival Description</a> (RiC-FAD); <a
href="https://www.ica.org/resource/records-in-contexts-conceptual-model/">Records
in Contexts–Conceptual Model</a> (RiC-CM); and <a
href="https://www.ica.org/resource/records-in-contexts-ontology/">Records
in Contexts–Ontology</a> (RiC-O).</p>
<p>RiC-FAD is a brief description of the foundational principles and
purposes of archival description. RiC-CM is a high-level conceptual
model that focuses on intellectually identifying and describing records,
and the contexts within which they were created and used. RiC-O is a
specific implementation of the RiC-CM formally expressed in the World
Wide Web Consortium standard Web Ontology Language (OWL). RiC-AG is
intended to provide archival practitioners, developers, and managers
guidance in understanding and implementing archival description systems
based on RiC, particularly focusing on the RiC-CM.</p>
<p>The International Council on Archives (ICA) Expert Group on Archival
Description (EGAD) recognizes that RiC significantly differs
conceptually from the previous ICA standards, in particular ISAD(G), the
most widely used and influential. RiC-AG is intended to help the
archival community understand RiC, in particular RiC-CM. RiC-AG is also
intended to help archives and developers that support archives in
developing strategies for implementing RiC, and in managing the
transition from existing practices and systems to RiC-based practices
and systems.</p>
<p>In developing RiC-AG, the EGAD recognizes that archives differ in
current approaches to description and in the systems that support these
practices. As a result, scenarios for using RiC will vary considerably.
To assist in designing the RiC-AG, the EGAD solicited user stories from
the community in April 2024. EGAD also re-examined user comments
collected after the publication of the RiC-CM 0.2 consultation draft.
The goal of the survey and review of past comments was to help the EGAD
in identifying appropriate content for the RiC-AG. Nevertheless, while
RiC-AG aims to provide broad guidance that will be helpful across a
range of scenarios, it does not offer specific guidance that will
address every possible user context.</p>
<p>RiC-AG is a draft document. With the initial release, the EGAD
invites the community to provide feedback. Are the sections appropriate?
Are they helpful or not? Is the language clear and understandable? How
about the diagrams? Are there issues or challenges not addressed? Are
there specific areas where additional examples or diagrams would be
helpful? The EGAD would very much like to establish an ongoing dialogue
with the community in the further development of the RiC-AG.</p>
