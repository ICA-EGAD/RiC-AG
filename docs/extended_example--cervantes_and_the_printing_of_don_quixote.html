<p>We present a narrative form example of extended archival description
in RiC. We hope it may be a source of inspiration — the approach as much
as the details.</p>
<p>We do not wish to suggest that every description in RiC will or
should look like this: far from it. It is fully possible to express
older and more traditional approaches in RiC: see <a
href="getting_started_with_ric.html">§2</a> and <a

found in <a

<p>In 1604, on the 11th of September in Valladolid, Antonio de Herrera y
Tordesillas (<a

wrote, in response to a memorial submitted to the Council of Castile (<a

<a

<p>These <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/12631375?nm">two
records</a> — Cervantes’ memorial and Herrera’s report — are of rather
complex provenance, and fit into a rich context. Let us explore how RiC,
along with complementary standards, can express aspects of this.</p>
<h2 data-number="8.3" id="councils"><span
class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Council<span class="end-of-section-heading">s<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>By the time Cervantes wrote his memorial the kingdoms of Castile and
Aragon, though still to a large degree distinct, had had a single
monarch since the marriage of Queen Isabella I of Castile (<a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/46207">PARES</a>,
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_I_of_Castile">Wikipedia</a>)
and King Ferdinand II of Aragon (<a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/46340?nm">PARES</a>,
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon">Wikipedia</a>)
in the 15th century. In addition to making up roughly the mainland of
modern Spain, the one or the other of the kingdoms controlled what is
now referred to as the Spanish empire (including much of the Americas
and considerable parts of Europe).</p>
<p>Governance was through entities known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysynodial_System">councils</a>
(consejos), one each originally for Castile and Aragon, these pre-dating
the unification of their crowns. Gradually numerous councils were split
off from these two, with responsibility either for a particular
territory, for example the Council of the Indies (<a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/46286?nm">PARES</a>,
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_Indies">Wikipedia</a>),
or for a particular function, for example the Council of Finance (<a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/50914?nm">PARES</a>);
both had their origin in the Council of Castile. Councils were also
created from scratch, the most important of which had both kingdoms
within their remit, for example the Council of State (<a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/46620?nm">PARES</a>,
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Council_of_State">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>That Herrera was in Vallodolid situates our two records at a quite
specific point in time. The royal court in Castile, to which the Council
of Castile was attached, had been in Madrid for several decades until
1601, and moved to Valladolid only from 1601 to 1606, whereupon it moved
permanently back to Madrid. This event is of archival significance
because in conjunction with the move a transfer of some records of the
Council of Castile to Simancas was made, along with records of certain
of the other councils.</p>
<h2 data-number="8.4" id="simancas"><span
class="header-section-number">8.4</span> Simanca<span class="end-of-section-heading">s<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>Let us pause to discuss the General Archive of Simancas (<a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/46558?nm">PARES</a>,
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivo_General_de_Simancas">Wikipedia</a>)
a little; it is important both for its holdings and its history. In RiC,
one would primarily regard an archive as a Corporate Body, namely as an
institution working with archival material; in this sense, the General
Archive of Simancas was founded around sixty years before Cervantes’
request, as we shall discuss in more detail below. Secondly, an archive
usually has a physical location, Place in RiC; in the case of the
General Archive of Simancas, its purpose-built location within the
pre-existing Castle of Simancas is regarded as having being completed in
the 1580s. We can model this as follows.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/general_archive_of_simancas.svg"><img
src="diagrams/general_archive_of_simancas.svg"
alt="General archive of Simancas" /></a></p>
<p>The date given here for the founding of the General Archive of
Simancas comes from a <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/12883369?nm">royal
decree</a> of the 16th of September 1540. It stipulates that certain
documents be sent to Juan Mosquera de Molina, an official (alcaide:
commandant/warden) at the Castle of Simancas — Simancas is not mentioned
explicitly. We could embellish the above modelling as follows to capture
this, noting that the RiC relation <em>has or had authority over</em>
only implies some kind of authority, not over-arching authority.
Included is the nuance that the decree was, apart from the signature,
actually written not by the king but by Juan Vázquez de Molina (<a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/168028?nm">PARES</a>,
<a
href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_V%C3%A1zquez_de_Molina">Wikipedia</a>)
(in Flanders, as it happens, though we do not include this in the
diagram!).</p>

<h2 data-number="8.5" id="records-of-the-council-of-castile-i"><span

Castile <span class="end-of-section-heading">I<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>Although the <em>Collection of the Council of Castile</em> in the two
diagrams above is <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/117085">described</a>
as a fonds, the holdings at Simancas encompass only a small proportion
of the archived records of the Council of Castile. Of these, apart from
those mentioned earlier which were sent to Simancas in 1606, many —
mainly older, including those specified in the founding royal decree of
1540 — were organized and collected through the work of Diego de Ayala,
the first archivist at Simancas, between his appointment by royal decree
in 1561 (along with a second archivist who died shortly afterwards, in
1563) and his death in 1594. Almost all other records travelled to
Madrid with the royal court. The following diagram models all of this.
Here <em>Records of the Council of Castile held at Simancas</em> is the
same as <em>Collection of the Council of Castile</em> above; a different
terminology has been chosen for clarity.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/records_of_the_council_of_castile.svg"><img
src="diagrams/records_of_the_council_of_castile.svg"
alt="Records of the Council of Castile" /></a></p>
<p>Any model in RiC can be understood as having an ‘open-world’
semantics: information can always be added for a higher degree of nuance
and accuracy. Here details could be included from the royal decree
mandating Diego de Ayala’s appointment as head archivist at Simancas, or
Record Sets corresponding to accruals at Simancas after 1606 could be
brought in.</p>
<p>Points of note in the modelling include the following.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A distinction is available in RiC between the end date of a
Record Set and the last date of creation of a Record in that Record Set.
A Record Set might indeed have been ‘open’ for a period of time after
the last record belonging to it was created — as long as an organization
existed, for example, if the Record Set documents the activities of that
organization. Both variants appear in the model, by means of the
relations <em>has end date</em> and <em>has or had all members with
creation date</em> (the latter being a period of time): that all of the
records of the Council of Castile held at Simancas were created between
1437 and 1648 <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/117085">comes
from PARES</a>; whilst we can at least say that the last record arranged
by Diego de Ayala was created before his death, even if we do not have
the exact date.</p></li>
<li><p>As in <a
href="case_study--how_might_ric_be_of_use_to_indigenous_communities_and_other_minority_groups.html#challenging-over-reliance-on-sources">§7.3</a>
and <a
href="case_study--how_might_ric_be_of_use_to_indigenous_communities_and_other_minority_groups.html#weaving-together-fragments">§7.5</a>,
free use has been made of the Record Set entity as an intellectual
abstraction; namely that, unlike a Record, it is not required to have an
Instantiation, as discussed in <a
href="faq--the_instantiation_entity.html#instantiations-of-record-sets">§6c.4</a>.
For instance, though <em>Records of the Council of Castile arranged by
Diego de Ayala</em> is a meaningful aggregation intellectually and plays
a useful role in the model, it does not have a physical counterpart: the
collections of records which Diego de Ayala arranged are stored here and
there at Simancas, within the physical incarnations of the fonds and
series which they are identified in PARES as belonging to — the fact
that Diego de Ayala arranged them was not a principle which had an
immediate bearing on their physical organization.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as is likely for any Record Set corresponding to a
traditional archival entity such as a fonds or series, <em>Records of
the Council of Castile held at Simancas</em> does have an Instantiation;
whilst <em>Records of the Council of Castile held at the royal court
after its move to Madrid in 1606</em> may have had one.</p></li>
<li><p>The two Activities in the diagram each have an <em>Activity
Type</em> attribute corresponding to a fundamental archival practice:
arrangement and accrual. Classifying an Activity in this way is
important for discovery — allowing arrangement and accrual to be used as
entry points — as well as for inter-operability. See <a
href="faq--how_to_describe_activities_such_as_digitization_appraisal_or_disposition.html">§6d</a>
for further discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>In the model, Event is used once, and Activity twice. As
discussed in <a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#can-you-elaborate-upon-the-difference-between-activity-and-event">§6a.3.3</a>,
RiC-CM defines the difference between the two as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Activity is an agent designed and performed event that has an
intended purpose or purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The movement of the royal court to Madrid, though it had archival
consequences, was not made for archival reasons; it ‘simply happened’
from an archival point of view, hence we have regarded it as an Event.
The two Activities in the model, on the other hand, correspond to
archival practices, i.e. were carried out with the involvement of an
archivist, with intended archival repercussions.</p></li>
<li><p>It is almost always the case in RiC that a relation or attribute
can be used more than once for the same entity, as <em>has or had
location</em> is in the diagram. That the Habsburg royal court had both
Valladolid and Madrid as locations would likely prompt somebody for whom
this is significant to dig more deeply to understand it; in this way,
the flexibility can facilitate discovery, which can be aided by
inclusion of meta-metadata (as discussed in <a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#do-you-have-examples-illustrating-chapter-6-of-ric-cm">§6a.3.4</a>),
and/or by rich surrounding description.</p>
<p>To elaborate a little, in this context RiC allows for the elaboration
upon relations by certain attributes, as mentioned in <a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#do-you-have-examples-illustrating-chapter-6-of-ric-cm">§6a.3.4</a>.
Here for instance Date of Relation could be used in conjunction with
<em>has or had location</em> to express that the court was at Valladolid
from 1601 to 1606, and similarly for Madrid.</p>
<p>RiC-O makes use of a technical device known as an n-ary relation
class to formalise relation attributes. It could look as follows in this
case, where <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/RiC-O_1-1.html#PlaceRelation">rico:PlaceRelation</a>
is the n-ary relation class, and the relation <em>is associated with
place</em>, of which <em>has or had location</em> is a sub-relation,
becomes a shortcut for the path consisting of the two horizontal arrows
in the diagram. We mean ‘shortcut’ only informally here, but in fact it
exists in a formal sense in RiC-O, albeit one more arrow would have been
needed in the diagram — we shall not go into this further here.</p></li>

<p>Literature was censored in Habsburg Spain at the time, and requests
for licenses for printing such as Cervantes’ were handled by the
Escribanía de Cámara (Notary of the Chamber). Thus Cervantes’ memorial
and Herrera’s report belonged to the sub-fonds <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/1538322">Escribanía
de cámara de Ayala. Consejo de Castilla</a> corresponding to the notary
in office at the time (Ayala — not the archivist at Simancas) —
specifically to the series <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/12631373">Expedientillos
de la Escribanía de Ayala. 1606</a>.</p>
<p>These records were amongst those which moved with the royal court to
Madrid. Over the next couple of centuries, they remained at the part of
the court handling matters of justice: the offices of the subsequent
notaries <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/10069?nm">Pinilla</a>,
<a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/10067?nm">Escariche</a>,

and <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/10070?nm">Vicario</a>
inherited the records of their predecessors. The Ancien Régime gradually
fell, and the Council of Castile was dissolved in 1834; the <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/48873?nm">Supreme
Court</a> and <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/48968">Ministry
of Grace and Justice</a>, both enshrined in Spain’s constitution of
1812, took over its role with respect to justice.</p>
<p>The records of the Council of Castile fell into a certain state of
neglect; a need to address this was recognized, but Simancas had no
space to receive them. Eventually — omitting the details of various
earlier alleviations — the National Historical Archive (<a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/48087?nm">PARES</a>,
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Historical_Archive_(Spain)">Wikipedia</a>)
was constructed in the second half of the nineteenth century, and
between 1896 and 1899 the fonds of the Council of Castile held at the
Supreme Court and the Ministry of Grace and Justice, as well as at the
Council of State, were sent there.</p>
<p>Cervantes’ memorial and Herrera’s report belonged by this time to the
series <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/7306718">Archivo
Antiguo de Consejo. Consultas y Decretos</a> (Ancient Archive of the
Council. Consultations and Decrees), compiled from the records of
Escribanías de Cámara (Notaries of the Chamber) around the time of the
dissolving of the Council of Castile in the 1830s. It is not clear which
of the afore-mentioned three institutions held this series, but if we
assume for the sake of concreteness that it was the Supreme Court, we
can model much of all this as follows.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/transfer_to_national_historical_archive.svg"><img
src="diagrams/transfer_to_national_historical_archive.svg"
alt="Transfer to Archivo Histórico Nacional" /></a></p>
<p>The relation attribute Certainty of Relation in RiC-CM could have
been used in the model in conjunction with the <em>has or had
holder</em> and <em>is or was performed by</em> relations in the model
which point to the Supreme Court to indicate that they are uncertain, or
more precisely that they express one of three possibilities.</p>
<h2 data-number="8.7" id="extraction-of-cervantes-memorial"><span

memoria<span class="end-of-section-heading">l<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>In the 1980s, archivists at the National Historical Archive made the
decision to extract into a new Record Set (<a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/12631375?nm">Colección
de pergaminos y documentos del Consejo de Castilla</a>) records of the
Council of Castile whose instantiations were identified as vulnerable
from a conservation or display point of view. Cervantes’ memorial and
Herrera’s report were moved into this Record Set (both intellectually
and physically — the new Record Set has an Instantiation: the
Instantiations of the Records belonging to it are held together, not in
their original locations) around 2011-12, when a high level of interest
in and requests for consultation of the material led to conservation
concerns.</p>
<p>As the description of this new Record Set in PARES draws attention
to, the creation of it did not adhere to traditional organic provenance
principles, though much had already been lost in this regard by the time
of the transfer to the National Historical Archive — the arrangement of
records following the move did not necessarily much ameliorate the
situation, it seems. RiC’s conception of a Record Set, explored in <a
href="faq--record_or_record_set.html">§6b</a>, <a
href="faq--the_instantiation_entity.html#instantiations-of-record-sets">§6c.4</a>,
and <a
href="case_study--how_might_ric_be_of_use_to_indigenous_communities_and_other_minority_groups.html">§7</a>,
does, though, fully encompass definition according to conservation
criteria, the decentralized nature of RiC allowing for the provenance to
be as accurately expressed in this case as in a hierarchical approach.
We illustrate one way to model it in this case below — one could include
more, as one almost always can!</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/extraction_of_cervantes_memorial.svg"><img
src="diagrams/extraction_of_cervantes_memorial.svg"
alt="Extraction of Cervantes’ memorial" /></a></p>
<p>Given that RiC makes a careful distinction between record resources
and their instantiations, one might balk a little at the above: is it
not solely a matter of the original instantiation of Cervantes’
memorial, so that it is wrong to refer above to the extraction of the
latter as a record? A Record, though, is more in RiC than its contents:
all aspects of its context, as far as these are relevant archivally,
play a role in defining it. That certain instantiations of a record are
conservationally vulnerable is both relevant for an archivist working
with the record and has implications for users of the record. The
regarding of Cervantes’ memorial as belonging to a new Record Set
expresses this, adding a new layer of context to Cervantes’ memorial as
a Record. In this way, RiC’s conception of a Record is a dynamic one:
over time, a record’s context can be added to and refined.</p>

<p>As discussed in <a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#is-describing-the-content-of-a-record-within-rics-domain">§6a.3.1</a>,
whilst the content of a Record is a priori outside the domain of RiC,
RiC allows for and encourages the use of other standards to this end.
Let us give an example of this.</p>
<p>Cervantes’ memorial contains his signature, which is of both archival
— with regard for example to the authoritativeness of the memorial as a
Record — and wider scholarly significance; it would be appropriate to
model it in RiC as a Record Part. We could assert in free-text, by means
of the Scope and content attribute or via an Activity, that the content
of this Record Part is Cervantes’ signature, but RiC cannot directly
express this in a structured way.</p>

<p>Cervantes had an eventful life! It is not only as the author of the
memorial on the printing of Don Quixote that he appears in the archives
of the Councils, as we shall now explore a little.</p>
<p>In the early 1570s, Cervantes served as a soldier, but was captured
at sea by pirates, along with his brother, in 1575; for several years he
was held for ransom in Algiers. Cervantes’ mother, Leonor de Cortinas,
worked to free her sons; a <a
href="http://www.universocervantes.com/archivo-documental/2">royal
decree from 1576</a> details the granting to her of 60 escudos to this
end. In 1578 the <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/46764">Council
of War</a>, one of the territory-wide councils which <a
href="#councils">took form in the 1500s</a>, granted merchandise valuing
2000 ducats towards the paying off Cervantes’ ransom, in view of his
good service — albeit that she had requested 8000 ducats’ worth! A <a
href="https://www.cultura.gob.es/va/dam/jcr:cb292c05-5e31-43df-95aa-c7ca05bcdd9b/18-gym-lib-34-2-66.pdf">transcript</a>
of the record of this is available.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cervantes’ father, Rodrigo de Cervantes, lobbied for his
release too. This is documented by a record of the Council of the Indies
(<a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/46286">PARES</a>,
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_Indies">Wikipedia</a>),
again from 1578, belonging to the Record Set <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/126853">Expediente
sobre los méritos y servicios de Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra</a>
(Dossier on the merits and services of Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra)
which is held at the General Archive of the Indies (<a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/46555?nm">PARES</a>,
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Archive_of_the_Indies">Wikipedia</a>).
That the provenance principle behind the formation of this dossier was
one of subject matter is no hindrance in RiC.</p>
<p>In the diagram below we suggest a way in RiC to place both of these
records, along with a third which also belongs to the afore-mentioned
dossier, into the context of the ransoming of Cervantes. We include
Cervantes’ memorial on the printing of Don Quixote to illustrate how
Cervantes can be seen as providing a bridge between archival
contexts.</p>

<p>The use of archives — in legal matters, for research, and so on —
situates the archival domain in a very broad context. Whilst the latter
is not directly within RiC’s scope, RiC does allow for building a bridge
from the archives to the uses of archival records in the world beyond.
Let us discuss how in a couple of examples.</p>
<p>In Spain, a project was begun a few years ago linking archival
materials to scholarly documents citing them, resulting in the online
catalogue <a
href="https://pares.cultura.gob.es/metapares/inicio">MetaPARES</a>.
Though it is not complete at the time of writing, there are already <a
href="https://pares.cultura.gob.es/metapares/generalSearchForm?textGen=Cervantes&amp;pagNum=1&amp;pagSize=10">quite
a number</a> of entries pertaining to Cervantes.</p>
<p><a
href="https://pares.cultura.gob.es/metapares/vistaunica?id=235742522">One
of these</a> concerns an <a
href="https://analescervantinos.revistas.csic.es/index.php/analescervantinos/article/view/325">article
from 2016</a> bringing to light new biographical details on Cervantes,
these coming from certain records held at the Archivo General de Indias.
The article contains within it transcriptions of these records. In the
diagram below we suggest how in RiC one might bring the article into the
archival description context. This enriches the latter — facilitating
the discovery of the transcriptions, for instance — as well as the wider
scholarly context in which it resides.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/new_biographical_details.svg"><img
src="diagrams/new_biographical_details.svg"
alt="New biographical details" /></a></p>
<p>Here, in addition to RiC, we have made use of the <a
href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/bibo/">Bibliographic
Ontology</a>, <a
href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/">Dublin
Core</a>, and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-schema/">RDF
schema</a>. A few points of note:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>As discussed in <a
href="faq--the_instantiation_entity.html#when-does-a-derived-instantiation-represent-a-new-record">§6c.3</a>,
an Instantiation derived from another, such as the transcription in the
diagram above, might be regarded as an Instantiation of a new Record;
this is a matter of judgement. That we have not introduced such a new
Record into the diagram is primarily because the transcription, being
found within the text of the research article, arguably has a relatively
subservient character — easing the reading of the source materials to
which the article refers, for instance — and thus perhaps does not have
the import which judging it a new Record might be thought to imply.</li>
<li>We see how Thing is useful when forming a bridge between RiC and
other domains; several relations in RiC allow Thing in their domain,
range, or both, and it can be very helpful, as in the diagram, to employ
these in such cases.</li>
<li>The diagram illustrates how RiC allows for making contact with
broader conceptions of a document. From a bibliographic point of view,
the Record in the diagram is indistinguishable ontologically from any
other cited document; within RiC it is something more.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us explore a second example. The intellectual Dámaso Alonso (<a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/142688">PARES</a>,
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A1maso_Alonso">Wikipedia</a>)
explored material in the reading rooms of the National Historical
Archive (as well the General Archive of the Indies and other Spanish
archival institutions); the Record Set <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/13002913">Expediente
de investigación del Archivo Histórico Nacional correspondiente a Dámaso
Alonso Fernández de las Redondas</a> (Research file of the National
Historical Archive relating to Dámaso Alonso) documents his studies.</p>
<p>Alonso was also a noted Cervantes scholar; for instance, in 1969, he
wrote the essay <em>Oscillation in the character of Sancho</em>. In the
diagram below we suggest one way in which both the latter work and the
research file could be joined in RiC via Dámaso Alonso, making use of
the same three additional standards. As well as simply enriching the
context of Cervantes’ memorial, this might allow for influences upon
Alonso’s work of archival or wider scholarly significance to more
readily be perceived.</p>
