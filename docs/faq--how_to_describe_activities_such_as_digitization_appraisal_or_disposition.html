<p>As touched upon in <a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#are-activity-and-event-central-entities-in-ric-how-about-rule-and-place">§6a.3.2</a>,
the Activity entity is important in RiC. It is very flexible: it might
be used when describing functional provenance — there are several
examples of this in, for instance, <a
href="faq--record_or_record_set.html">§6b</a> and <a
href="faq--sequences.html">§6e</a>; or for incorporating context which
bears upon a Record Resource in less direct ways, as for instance in
some of the examples in <a
href="case_study--how_might_ric_be_of_use_to_indigenous_communities_and_other_minority_groups.html">§7</a>
and <a
href="extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote.html">§8</a>;
or for expressing meta-metadata, as discussed in <a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#do-you-have-examples-illustrating-chapter-6-of-ric-cm">§6a.3.4</a>.</p>
<p>Here, though, we will focus upon using Activity to describe archival
and records management processes. <a href="#digitization">First</a> we
will discuss digitization, and <a
href="#appraisal-and-disposition">then</a> appraisal and disposition.
When it comes to the use of the Activity entity, the same modelling
pattern will be used in both cases; it generalizes to many other kinds
of processes. Other aspects of the modelling may be of independent
interest.</p>
<p>Much of the discussion, especially the core aspect of how the
Activity entity is used, is appropriate for a beginner in RiC who has
acquired a little experience. Certain aspects are a little more
advanced.</p>

<p>As we did in <a
href="faq--record_or_record_set.html#parish-registers">§6b.3</a>, let us
consider a parish register for Bratsberg Church between 1938 and 1952.
For an example of how it looks, see for instance the <a
href="https://media.digitalarkivet.no/view/39552/50">page for deaths in
1939 and 1940</a>.</p>
<p>This parish register was scanned in 2005 by the Regional State
Archives in Trondheim, a sub-entity within the National Archives of
Norway. We might model this as follows, incorporating some context. At
its heart is the way in which the Activity entity and the relations
<em>affects or affected</em>, <em>results or resulted in</em>,
<em>occurred at date</em>, and <em>is or was performed by</em> are
used.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/digitization.svg"><img
src="diagrams/digitization.svg" alt="Digitization" /></a></p>
<p>Some notes on the modelling:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>As discussed <a
href="faq--record_or_record_set.html#parish-registers">§6b.3</a>, we
might model the parish register as a Record or a Record Set depending on
the context; we have chosen Record here.</p></li>
<li><p>The Rule brought into the modelling concerning blocking of pages
has been applied to all pages to do with births in the digitization, as
can be <a href="https://media.digitalarkivet.no/view/39552/6">seen</a>
in the early parts of the parish register.</p></li>
<li><p>For why digitization is regarded as an Activity pertaining to an
Instantiation as oppposed to a Record Resource, see the discussion in <a
href="faq--the_instantiation_entity.html#do-i-have-an-instantiation-or-a-record-resource">§6c.2</a>:
the intellectual aspect of the Record Resource — the information it
holds — is essentially unaltered; digitization takes one inscription of
that information to another. From a more functional point of view, a
digitization may make a Record Resource more widely available — online,
or via another electronic channel — or it may contribute to more robust
preservation of it; but, in the first instance at least, this again has
to do with how concrete inscriptions of the information held in a Record
Resource are used, without affecting that information itself.</p></li>
<li><p>We refer to <a
href="faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#can-you-elaborate-upon-the-difference-between-activity-and-event">§6a.3.3</a>
for more on why Activity and not Event is used in all three cases in the
modelling, including the one-off Activity of the digitization of this
particular parish register: the degree of time that an Activity lasts is
not so important in this regard, rather…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Activity is an agent designed and performed event that has an
intended purpose or purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…which applies here.</p></li>
<li><p>In RiC-O, one has <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/RiC-O_1-1.html#hasOrHadAnalogueInstantiation">rico:hasOrHadAnalogueInstantiation</a>
and <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/RiC-O_1-1.html#hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation">rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation</a>
available as refinements of <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/RiC-O_1-1.html#hasOrHadInstantiation">rico:hasOrHadInstantiation</a>;
these would complement nicely the use of the Representation Type
attribute in the modelling.</p></li>
<li><p>Digitization could of course also apply e.g. to audio material;
the noting of the Carrier Type and Representation Type of an
Instantation as in the modelling, in addition to the inclusion of
scanning as a specific form of digitization, allows for deducing which
kind of digitization is meant in this case — even by a machine.</p></li>
<li><p>The ‘Digitization’ and ‘Scanning’ Activities serve a slightly
different purpose to the ‘Scanning’ Activity Type in the model. As is
discussed in more depth in <a
href="faq--how_to_use_ric_with_vocabularies.html">§6f</a>, a primary
purpose of Activity Type and similar attributes in RiC is categorization
— this facilitating simple querying, for instance — often making use of
a standardized vocabulary. To this end, as in the other cases, Activity
Type is defined in RiC-CM to be non-repeatable, with the expectation
that the narrowest available categorization is used, as in the
diagram.</p>
<p>The inclusion of the ‘Digitization’ and the ‘Scanning’ Activities, on
the other hand, permits us to express the nuance that the one is a
special case of the other, but more significantly allows us to connect
the digitization of the parish register to a much broader context: all
kinds of relations and attributes might have their source in either the
Digitization or the Scanning Activity.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the digitized instantiation in this example were, say, in such a
format as to allow for annotating, and if it were indeed to be
annotated, it might in the end, as per the discussion in <a
href="faq--the_instantiation_entity.html#when-does-a-derived-instantiation-represent-a-new-record">§6c.3</a>,
be judged an Instantiation of a new Record. We might model this as
follows.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/digitization--new_record.svg"><img
src="diagrams/digitization--new_record.svg"
alt="Digitization resulting in new record" /></a></p>
<p>On a different note, as it happens, all of the parish registers for
Bratsberg Church up to 1961 have been digitized. We could model this as
follows, regarding all of these parish registers as aggregating into a
Record Set. The only change from the case of a single register is that
the Date Entity is now a period of time (one could make use of the Date
Type attribute to emphasize this if one wished).</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/digitization--record_set.svg"><img
src="diagrams/digitization--record_set.svg"
alt="Digitization record set" /></a></p>
<p>The modelling of the single parish register with which we began fits
into the above as follows.</p>

<h2 data-number="6d.3" id="appraisal-and-disposition"><span
class="header-section-number">6d.3</span> Appraisal and dispositio<span class="end-of-section-heading">n<a href="#"><img class="to-top-icon" src="icons/up_arrow.svg" alt="To top of page" title="To top of page"/></a></span></h2>
<p>We turn to an <a
href="https://groups.google.com/g/records_in_contexts_users/c/X9KYzx45kZE/m/_Nx6CpsuBQAJ">example</a>
from the RiC mailing list, discussing appraisal by a records management
organization in Flanders of a series which we denote by R. One outcome
of the appraisal is the decision to destroy, ten years later (say), a
file within the series, which we denote by F. R has an entry in a
government register, and the outcomes of the appraisal of R, including
the disposition of F, are required by law to be logged in this
register.</p>
<p>The register log indicating that F is to be destroyed can be regarded
as providing a mandate for that destruction. It so happens in this case
that the same records management organization that conducted the
appraisal is also likely to carry out the disposition when the time
comes. A description in RiC of all of this might look as follows.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/appraisal.svg"><img src="diagrams/appraisal.svg"
alt="Appraisal" /></a></p>
<p>Some notes on the modelling:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The key aspect is the way in which appraisal of R is formulated as
an Activity in conjunction with the relations <em>is or was affected
by</em>, <em>results or resulted in</em>, and <em>performs or
performed</em>, entirely analogously to in the approach to digitization
above.</li>
<li>We have chosen to model the government register as a Record Set, and
the entry for R in the register as a Record. This is because, in the
context we are exploring, the emphasis is upon R rather than upon the
register as a record of appraisals in Flanders; see <a
href="faq--record_or_record_set.html">§6b</a> for detailed discussion of
this kind of judgement.</li>
<li>RiC-O includes the object property <a
href="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/RiC-O_1-1.html#hasDestructionDate">rico:hasDestructionDate</a>;
if one is using RiC-O, this would be a bit more precise than <em>is date
associated with</em>.</li>
<li>There is nothing in RiC that prevents referring to dates in the
future, despite the verb tense of some relations. These may be changed
in future versions of RiC, with steps towards this having already been
taken in the latest version (1.1) of RiC-O.</li>
<li>Similarly to in the digitization example, we might have asserted
that the Activity ‘Appraisal of R’ has Activity Type ‘Appraisal’; but
viewing it as a sub-event of ‘Appraisal’ as a general Activity is useful
here, allowing for a bridge to be built via a Rule to the logging of the
outcomes of the appraisal in the government register.</li>
